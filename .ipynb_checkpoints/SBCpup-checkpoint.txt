so you don't need to go borrow equipment from anybody to to do the feet do the hooves
well we're gonna have to find somewhere to get something
so mae
i'm gonna
mae lynne
we're not gonna do the feet today i'm gonna wait till like early in the morning to do those cause y mean you get so tired n you just it takes well it takes me longer than most people cause you know i'm not as strong and and i'm not as good as like somebody that would do it all the time you know mean oh mean trim horses and stuff like that but mean i'm not like i'm not uh don't know how to say it but you know they do it for a living you know most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time and i'm not that good or and i'm not very strong
did they train you
did they train you that
yeah
so you have your own equipment
but
don't have my own equipment at all dad you know has done some of it that's another thing too is kinda had a b general idea of kinda how to do it just watching him or and watching people come to our place and doing it and stuff you know and don't know then down there um it's mandatory you have to to graduate you know or well to get the degree you know you have to take this class and you can only take if you want to you can only take it for eight weeks and if you wanna go on in it you n then you can go on you know and decided to go ahead and go on in it and the first part of it is like well we have lecture then we have lab and like the first part of it we just go into the classroom and he like in the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work mean it that's just kinda how it happens you know because he kinda has to tell you they go over the whole the whole part of the horse mean all the skeleton part of it you know and and they go through every kinda ligament and mean there's millions of ligaments and millions of tendons you know well not millions but mean
bet
then so we had to know these tendons and ligaments and then all the bones and you know all the way up from the shoulder down and then from the hip down you know all the way down to the hoof and then the bone in the hoof and then all the wall and you know of the hoof and what everything was called there and then he went over on how to trim it and where you th there's a white line that you go by and a horse has this little white line and you clean it out with the with the hoof knife you know and then there and then you can see this little white line and that's kinda where you go by to you know the horse kinda helps you out because it has that little white line right there
mhm
that's where you kinda kinda need a little guide of where you trim and am still scared to do it because you know mean you can make a horse go lame by doing it
really
well you can trim em too short and make em you know and they're just a little bit for f the first couple of days you know mean they're just sore that's not bad but sometimes you can get it really bad you can really make a horse really bad and they m you know then they have to like keep em away from anything you know get em really in the soft ground and no hard pebbles or hard clods of dirt or anything so don't know i'm a little scared about doing it yet you know get em really long mean they're still long when get done with them lot of times like i'll get done and i'll think i'm done and i'll look at look down at the horse's hoof and it's still it's too long and then like would never ever ever trust myself to shoe a horse see we did that too we did we did a lot of stuff we did a lot of stuff with the like we had the um the burners you know and you'd put the you'd have you started out with the straight iron you know and you'd stick it into the into the you know like actual blacksmithing and you'd put it into the hot coals you know and then we'd i i straight bar and we'd make it a a horseshoe out of it you know but these shoes we never did put on a horse we just put the shoes that were already made
on a horse and that's as far as we got mean if you would really get into it well as a matter of fact this is really funny you know there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere they're really
farrier
th yeah farrier is what they're called and the m the reason they were showing us this at college was just to get us to know if our trimmer and shoer weres doing it right and plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments which we we had it in another class too we that was kind of a double thing that we had in in another class so it was kinda review for us well it was a review for some people depend on what time of the year you took it you know if it was a review or not but anyway um what was gonna say forgot what was think
you said you never made the horseshoes
gonna say
but
well w um when we put em on a horse's hoof all we do they're already made they're round we pick out a size you know we'd like look at the horse's hoof and say okay this is a doubleaught this is an aught this is you know what s what size and doubleaught and aught are the ones that are most popular for you know the light horse you know mean you get into the big horses the like the clydesdales shires that's a d a whole different thing or ponies that's a whole different thing but we're talking just the regular light horses you know and aught and aught uh aught and doubleaught are the two sizes well anyway you go get your okay this is after you trimmed em and you go get your shoe it's already made it's already round you pick out your size you go look and every horse's hoof is shaped different it doesn't matter every horse is gonna have a little different shape and so what you have to do
so every every uh horseshoe is made custommade for the horse then
no no what what we do then that's that's where the ferrier comes in every shoe is like you get order you know would like a b case of doubleaught shoes you'd get the ferrier gets em you know that's the way it goes and then our job is to shape the shoe to the horse's foot and that it d it sounds easy but it's really hard to do mean some of em you have to you know like say okay say your shoe's like this and your horse's foot is just really wide or something well then you have to put it on the anvil and get the shoe stretched out well then once you stretch the shoe out well then the two corners they go out too you know okay your shoe's like this you stretch this out well then it's gonna make these go way out too and they get like this
right
then you have to round these back you know it's just it s it sounds easy but it's really hard to do and then would never do it cause i'd never trust myself to do it mean we had to do it
but it's just that people would volunteer their horses to the college because it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod mean that's just how much it costs could you imagine all those horses out there if we had em all shod that's
how many have you got
thirty bucks for twenty horses
twenty
twentyeight horses you know mean jesus that would be a th nine hundred dollars just like that mean could you imagine so w you know like a lot of people that have a lot of horses and stuff and that they're riding a lot they'll just let the college kids do em for em you know they're taking the risk of having their horse get lame but it really never happens cause we have our s instructor right there telling us this is what you do and it's not like there's a person that's just gung ho and goes and just trims their feet and puts the shoe on you know you d you d you can't do that and so we have our instructor right there and we asked a million questions all the time mean he e he just runs around everywhere you know so it's but uh what was gonna say oh and it's really tiring though and it you know like you get so i've only done like well at the end of the year now see took the second half of the course and right now i've probably only shod about five horses trimmed a lot of em and you know what we start out with this is the grossest of everything
what
we start out with dead horse hooves mean you know the the canneries you know and stuff you know the people that that kill the horses for meat and stuff you know they have all these legs and stuff and don't know everybody
thought they used the the horsehooves in for gelatin that's not so
you know think they do think a lot of times but then they they probably use em for everything don't know what all they use em for but anyway we get these horse hooves from this one cannery they they have to go a long ways to go get em like back east somewhere to get these horse hooves for the college they go back east and they get em and they freeze em you know so we have this frozen horse hoof that we have to start out on cause you don't want to cripple up a really good horse and like my first hoof that horse would have been lame like crazy but it was just and oh god it's so gross because sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit they start really stinking and stuff oh it's the grossest thing oh it's just so icky mean you have this piece of horse mean this leg that's oh it's just gross and like in some of em blood will spurt out you know and mean oh it's nothing it's the grossest thing and that's why that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory because at the beginning of the year it's just the it's the pits but once you get into it it's the funnest thing and you know it's really interesting to do stuff like that but would have never got into that class if there's no way if didn't have to have it there's no way mean heard everybody saying um you know like the people that took the class before talking about oh you have to do this you have to do that there's dead horse hooves you know you gotta and they stink and all this other stuff and was just going oh my god i'm never don't want to take that class so maybe i'll wait till next year and then thought no i'll get it out of the way now and then once got into it geez wanna take the second half of it it was just really interesting to me you know but at first it was kind of a bummer but i'm glad took it really glad it pays off especially you know twelve bucks for a trim mean that's twelve bucks every time can go out and trim my own horse's hooves
right
you know and wouldn't trust myself to do it with a horse that was really using a lot or anything but the ones that are standing around that's still twelve dollars you know mean whether the horse being used a lot or not that's twelve bucks and shoot can do those you know but always have anybody always have somebody that really knows what they're doing for the horses that i'm really really using but anyway wanna wait until the morning to do that because it's just too hot in the afternoon to try to sit out there mean you can get just exhausted anyway was gonna tell you about that the girl you know there isn't mary very many ferrier girls you know and her heart
that do this this summer met one jorgensen's they have one shoer that comes to their house all the time they've had him for years and years and years and guess like in minnesota it's real wet and stuff you know so like they really have to watch their shoes for not coming off because the hoof wall is so much softer it's like when you're down there your hands are softer and everything you know and they're not as dry or anything when you get back here we have dry hooves we have to watch out for like uh like the hooves being too dry we have to put ointment on em and stuff the back there they're too wet not this time of the year because you know they've had a dry year but usually they're too wet and that that shoe can just pull right off because it's just the hoof wall is so soft
it seems weird that that's like that
you know and nei never knew that until took this class either didn't realize that in you know if you think about it yeah if it rains a lot the horse is always wet and it's always moist and it's always on something moist
it's gonna be softer but never even thought about that until took this class so it's you know that's kinda stuff too that you think about but anyway they always have this one horseshoer and this girl's been in this ferrier uh she's going to an actual ferrier college they have a lot of those around a lot and she's going to one of em and she's been going for like nine months to this one and she's still got a lot more
where is the uh
left to go what
where is the
oh right here
guess i'll put it on it's not on
but anyway she has um she he's like taking her as a you know helping her out and stuff you know for the summer she's been working with him all summer and it's really different to see a girl doing it you know you just don't see that
at all ever jorgensen's have a girl or a g you know a guy they've had a guy being a horseshoer for a long time you know and they are um there's this girl that's working with him for the summer
unhunh
she's gonna be a ferrier
couldn't believe it and she's just little she's a tiny girl but boy tell you she's got arms the size of they're huge but she must only what is m blowing out of there
well that's what happens with that air conditioner it's just it gets dust accumulated in it see it's all over the
it was just on last night how does it get dust in it already
well it mae lynne for one thing the filters are dirty because it it so been so dry and the it all comes acrost the road you know and and then it builds up real bad with deposits out of the water
oh
in other words should be change filters
ugh god
know it won't last long but it sure does make a mess in the house
it makes a mess
need new filters
anyway this girl must only weigh like a hundred and ten pounds mean she's just a little shit and she's out there and she's got huge arms mean she's in shape like you can't believe she's out there just working away and those guys are so used to it that they do it all day long you know
mhm
that doesn't bother em a bit to just go out there and trim and trim and trim and shoe and everything but for me that's something i'm not used to and boy tell you you just sweat just rolls off of you just it's tiring the very at the very beginning when we first started doing it we only did like one hoof then we moved up to two then we moved up to a full horse you know and we were just slowly got in shape doing that you know but now if went to do that holy smokes i'd never be able to handle it
why
it's just it's a it's hard work it is really hard work you're bent over and it's you know it takes like don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either but you just oh it's just it's just hard hard work it's it doesn't seem like it would be but it is it's really takes a lot of muscles to do it too mean a lot those it's hard
you don't get kicked a lot
i've never been kicked ever but like it those college h is course you know like was talking our horses are a little better than most people's horse cause they've been around people a lot and they they don't get by with stuff mean we do get mad at our horses for you know whatever they do wrong we do get mad at em like noticed horses at college they just haven't been disciplined enough and they're just it's like a kid they're just are ornery you know and like they'll move around and kinda be ornery about half way but not not too bad i've never been kicked doing it at all and that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know just had to learn our safety of where to stand and how to stand you have to stand like these certain ways and oh and it's a killer on your back cause you're standing like this oh i'm sorry berry you're standing
whoops you're standing like this you know and like when you're in the back the horse's hoof lays like this right over you and you're like this working you know this is like a hoof knife then a you know
so you're always bent over
you're always bent over and like in the front you stick the horse's hoof between your leg you know kinda like that and you kinda you go like this you kinda bend down like this and you have the horse's hoof right here
it's hard on your back
it's really hard on your back like noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous too you know couldn't believe it she had like on this really p kinda short shirt you know there's this think that's cold
just don't it's if you rub something against it it's just
makes a sound nkay
so what what were you gonna do out there today what other what other things were you gonna
just go out and um
look at the filly
think more or less it's getting about so late now pretty much all we're gonna do is go out don't know what her plans really are but think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then maybe go to that seasonal dance or whatever it is is that what it's called
don't know
don't know what it's called either you know he said there was four guys doing that
doing what
the dance you know how he said there's four guys wonder if that means like since there's four seasons you know wonder if that has something to do with it
unhunh
since he called it a seasonal dance
he's a pretty neat guy thought
he spoke crow okay
got a kick out of him when he kept saying it see this little cat little cat
don't wanna see the little cat know
know
that sounds like kitten
that sounds like kit
don't wanna say kitten that sounds stupid
so she named everybody in the class except for
about four people well think they asked for names
oh did they hunh that's funny look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
noticed on the on the case for the tape recorder too that it's all that it's all covered today look right here
look at your cigarettes even
look right here just
geez
just from sitting here for just a minute that's
look at the cigarettes
it's like ash is it from that must be from the fires or what
you know maybe it is maybe it is
uh
cause that one whole day you couldn't even see or anything from but look at your cigarettes just sitting there
oh yeah on the way into r from roundup yesterday morning the radio was on and they were talking about the weather and they said how we everybody woke up with ash all over their car today and
in roundup
on the way from roundup was listening to the radio yesterday morning and they were talking
so this was probably like a billings radio station or something like that
unhunh
is that right
they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today and guess just from the fires
it is
was telling mae lynne
hunh
uh day before yesterday it was the most weird day i've ever seen in my entire adult life it was um the wind was blowing real hot when first got up and it was early real early like seven o'clock in the morning that that wind was just hot and next thing you knew it was just overcast well the smoke all blew in just like there was a fire right around close and it was just dense you couldn't even hardly see very far away okay then it that s it just kinda blew the smoke in and then blew it out but then it was real hazy and there was just dust particles all over and it was you'd look at the sun and it would just look red mean you couldn't see the sun it was just
she said people were driving around with their lights on
and the lights were they didn't look like they were it's just from the drought and the dust you know and the smoke in the air i've never seen anything like it
she said like the lights looked a greenish color
they look a green
you know how they look yellow at night you know
they just looked green it was a weird ugly ugly day rana lee's gonna have a baby by the way
who is
rana lee
brian's wife
brian's wife
didn't even know she was pregnant three months ago of course guess they can get big in three months
well told you
too
what's her name
bran what's her name
rana lee
rana lee
unhunh
rana lee
hm
don't know why told you that rana lee she had a brother that died from asthma too seem like a lot of people mean that's weird that would know two people that died from asthma you know
why don't we go
just in
except
just in a matter of a year's time
this washing is
really
her brother was like just right out of high school mean you know did mom tell you about deb at all she probably really couldn't since genetta was there you know she was like she was in the hospital in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff ever since she was little she was in and out of the hospital
who was that debby
debby mean she was in
she loved horses so much
stuff on it
she was always like she's allergic to horsehair horse sweat
oh
you know stuff like that but she wouldn't quit riding em so
well
she's allergic to everything it doesn't matter
was saying it didn't matter what she did
did she ever go to a allergy doctor
or anybody like that
oh yeah she t well they she never did take shots did she
don't know why they should've they should have gotten her
don't know why they didn't either
w always wondered about that and she was s she had such severe asthma that would have done a little bit more for her think
if you wanna talk about somebody tired that girl that girl couldn't walk down to the street and back without taking a nap and me and mom always accused her of being lazy you know because she was just all she did was sleep
she sounded like she had more problems than
now that when we think about it she probably wasn't really lazy she's probably just exhausted mean you know if you think about it we like take everything for granted we take our air for granted you know then somebody like that every little breath is like and effort to em d and you know and if had to go through an effort just in breathing all the time
well debby got
would be tired too
debby got to the point where all she would do is when she did you know every just really often she would go to try to get enough air in and her they had an autopsy done on her and her heart was just hard on one side from labored breathing all of her life it had just labored her heart so bad she actually died of a heart attack
she did
they did have an autopsy done on her
it surprised me but they they did and it was actually a
her heart was hard
cardiac arrest mhm one side of her heart was just hard from the muscle the muscle was just hard from just labored breathing
geez
trying to breathe all the time
that's just sick
we thought she was just lazy and kind of worthless but we didn't realize what she was going through
you know maybe that's another reason why she didn't really maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff and maybe that's why she didn't really pay that much attention to amanda mean not because mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her but maybe it's because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too and knew it wasn't gonna last forever for her you know mean guess like right before she died and stuff she's like telling her mom like well if go want this here and want that there and you know just little things
is amanda her kid or
oh
she had a little threeyearold daughter
it's just too bad just hope orville and genetta get that little girl
oh they won't there's no
are they even trying
they can't they want her three months out of the year but they have no legal grounds mean you know he is the legal father and there's not much they can do
oh she was divorced
mhm
and he is such a weirdo this is the type of person that is like a hermit don't know what you'd call him
well they were rai raised backward
he's like
uh back woods
back woodsy
raised in the mountains didn't d
never came down out of the mountains he doesn't have any he doesn't know what's going on in this world
he doesn't he was just not properly brought
he mean he wouldn't even have the slightest idea
where was he from
um forget
idaho
idaho and
up in the mountains in idaho
um macley and
how can you teach a threeyearold to tap dance
can't imagine teaching a yeah really
who suggested this to em
have no idea it was probably my sisterinlaw's idea because think they saw that movie
tap
what was the
they had
the movie with that really hot tap dancer
oh that kid
he was actually here two weeks ago and missed him
at the at the jazz tap thing or whatever
was he a little kid
he's sixteen now
he's like yeah he's a teenager but he teaches these classes in new york
that boy he's supposed to be awesome
really fast
hm
but i'm sure that was the the impetus
have you seen him
just read an article on him
you you probably read the same examiner article read
probably yeah
talking about how gregory hines said he doesn't realize a human being can't tap that fast
right right
they were talking about how he's teaching these classes
hm
guess he really goes fast and
he k
he doesn't explain anything precisely
he has to double it down to like one fifth speed or something before they can g pick it
well i'm sure thomas is all over it
probably
mean he has a bro
could have seen him
guess that means his broken leg is doing okay
was wondering about that was imagining he had broke an arm or something
oh yeah
but it was his leg
that's like guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff
right he healed very quickly
guess kids' bones just like grow back really fast
mhm
think they're really soft to start with
they're made of rubber th that's it
that's why b little kids usually don't break their legs anyway
cause they're so
cause they're made of rubber
but they have more cartilage than w you know
aren't they real s aren't their k legs pretty soft
there's less calcium deposits in them and also
mm
they're still growing and the way bones grow is you make cartilage and then you deposit calcium in it
oh and then that turns into hard bone
so that's why they always have more flexibility cause as they're growing
hm
you're making cartilage so it al
mhm
they always have that until they reach adulthood in which case
they get old and cranky like the rest of us
it stops
unhunh
then they break
old and rickety and brittle
mhm
mhm uncoordinated and unflexible
right
stiff
inflexible
that too
what are you planning on doing with dancing harold you were taking some classes last fall
i'll take a few more as a
you will
it turns out as a spouse get in free
oh really
so
that's not bad
to group classes yeah
hm
so should do that
oh really
mhm
that's why you married her
some benefit
mm
hunh
mhm
better than nothing
oh cannot believe you said that
what a jerk you are
aren't you guys gonna stick up for me and beat up on him or something
he's bigger than am
he's not bigger than you
but he's my
he's my friend
tha that's right
you know who i'll stick up for
stuck up for you today at that store
that's true
you did you made me get the
mhm
um
that's right
the green scarf that's right he was my fashion consultant today

hm

that's right
well you don't know
we were at this dumb store and the clerk kept trying to keep us interested
hm
while she was buying
that's right
don't you wanna try on the men's clothes
i'm the one who suggested that so you wouldn't be so bored
well
so they tried on the men's clothes and they had a very small selection of men's clothes
mhm
they try on these really great pants and they look really good in them then they didn't buy em
right well
you know how boys are they never buy clothes
broke
broke yeah students are are broke
right
is that that or is that a real
that's a tape that's a tape
where's it coming from
the speaker over there

we have these are like
the world's worst speakers
where is the other one

thought that was the real thing
you think we have like a jazz band next door
in fact was getting ready to say
is there somebody downstairs playing
mean that was what first thought
it's our garage band
when when the jazz came on as compared to the other stuff for some reason it sounded like it was out there or kind of coming in from some place
unhunh
hm
hunh
well that would be nice to have a little jazz band next door
right
wouldn't it
mhm
usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street
that's fun too and teenagers kissing each other on the sidewalk

that's pretty good
just like him
with the right
mean that looks kinda like a black person
with red eyes and everything
so where is this from this isn't from africa is it
from indonesia
but that person looks black
which one is it
or do indonesian people look black
looks pink to me
the which one the
figure the second one from the top
tumenggung
the second from the top
tumenggung hunh
look at that and think yeah that looks like a brother
that's interesting
cause think indo indonesians
think
or people who've been to indonesia think that those guys like the two top ones have really european characteristics compared to indonesians
uh
just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big
their eyes are round
oh really
indonesians have real thin eyes and and flat noses and stuff don't know
except those well don't know the the bottom ones don't have flat noses either
that's true they all have b they all have big noses but they get bigger as you go up anyway
what do you think makes em look african
their mustaches
is it the the way their little beard goes
oh no that's not even relevant d just glanced at that
hunh
immediately saw this guy's face in oba oba
hunh that's interesting
he looks like that guy
poor guy
that is really interesting
bulging eyes
cause remember he came to bahia after one of his shows one night 's kinda funny
wow
well the top guy has a real thick lip
oh in his black leather jacket and his black
mm
klana has a real thick lip
hood hat
right
pretty bad overbite too
he's in oba oba
you know
smoking he didn't
then he tried to he danced with a friend of mine
what happened
but she didn't wanna dance with him anymore said boy he just wanted to get close to me
mm
said well can't blame him
oba oba
myeah
gross
mm
but i'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women they travel all over the world i'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em so that's what they expect from women
lot of groupies
fringe benefits
hm
the only fringe benefit of being a dancer probably
well in san francisco
but then again
you never know if it's a benefit or not either
that's true
didn't know this but apparently in brazil they have a very very high infection rate
really
oh
oh
probably
it's supposed to be very high
mm
you mean like
very unmonitored
higher than the united state
too
higher than around here
that's what i've heard
hm
wouldn't be surprised
have you heard these figures that like um it's something like forty percent of males in the bay area are supposed to be infected
well last july
oh really
this is what
of homosexual males or of males
of all males
of males in general
this infectious disease woman
or males under thirty think it is
at san francisco general
mhm
she said that this doesn't seem like it can be true but she said that ninety per cent of gay men are positive and fifty percent of all males are positive
that's what she said
fifty perc it was some like a m half or more than half of and it was fairly young men but were had been exposed to virus it wasn't necessarily that they were infected
well if you're positive it's the same difference
mhm
since they feel that sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease
mhm
but that's what she said now don't know if she meant the bay area or san francisco
but those are some ferocious numbers if one out of
that's just horrible
two guys you meet
cause there're a lot of women out there who apparently don't believe in using condoms
hm
i'm just amazed
dumb move
see i'd heard that it was mainly
really dumb
in t's mainly urban areas
that had this really disproportionately high propor um percentage and then like r rural areas or like you know central iowa and stuff had like ten percent or less of the males had been infected
well would assume san francisco is higher than most cities around the country
unhunh
mhm
but that just blew me away cause i'm thinking well gee if half of all the men are positive what does that mean about the women they're having sex with
right yeah
well
but and just talking with guys
in their twenties why mean these guys say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not this is what guys have been telling me
you know and i'm thinking can't believe that cause in this city with all the information available
it seems like
right yeah
stupid
people people have the information they need
it is just amazing that people in their twenties apparently aren't
right that's really scary
so guess it's time for me to become a priest
it's too dangerous out there
oh don't know
couldn't believe it this woman knew was gonna ask out god
you have to be catholic first
her sister who's an counselor
was telling me how her sister just won't use rubbers at all
hm
well where would she put them
i'm thinking
i'm thinking
well
how can you not
my sisters don't
mean what are they thinking
don't know
don't look at me
was just really amazed to hear that people in their twenties
we're innocent
cause figure
we don't have sex
growing up around here you would know better
in high school you know they teach about it
mhm
so
don't know
t only that but they have really lewd billboards all over the castro district
something's wrong
know
thought we got our electricity fixed
that's kind of scary
thought turned this off though
it's been doing
didn't
oh that's right
but
you did that's really scary then
this is salsa right
what what who is this
don't know it's from the radio station years ago when was in santa cruz
you know on sundays at ten o'clock
that's right now
kay what is that kay oh don't know what the radio station is
they play salsa
it begins with a kay though
they played this
they have a brazilian jazz hour is there a don't know what it was but it was like went to bahia
what's
last sunday got there at eight left a ten dropped this person off at home in foster city and came back and was noticing the songs they were playing on the radio were the exact same songs they were singing at bahia the b live band there
hm should turn on the radio statio you don't know what station it was on
was does that mean anything to you
pe you have to translate it to a number
was in a rental car so it was just whatever station it was on
mm
hm
but uh was just remembering being surprised cause didn't realize don't know anything about brazilian music you go to the brazilian club and they're singing songs apparently guess that's the popular stuff guess i'm so used to hearing those songs cause i've heard em for the past three months didn't think anything of it but then this guy played songs for a whole hour and it was like eighty per cent of those songs i'd that band had sung that very night
mhm pickup band's pretty good there viva
well they have a different band every night
who was it viva brazil oh went on the
friday night so maybe it was different band
um when did you do that
oh a while ago the dance floor's too small in that place though it's really annoying like this song
are they teaching any more lambada at uh
school
vivian was giving a lambada lesson
cause uh
when was there the other day
well my lambada's definitely getting better
really really wanna go out lambada dancing with you
mean i'm gonna start dancing with those brazilian women so can learn how to beat my hips mean cause their their hips are beating up against you you know like that fast hundred cycles per second or something
mean am not kidding it it is a different sensation entirely
when you're dancing with them
bet
the only way to learn how is to dance with them more
that's true
but feel like can start dancing with them now but uh
th don't don't they haven't done anything recently can't remember if they're going to
cause like sue swing taught that class for two months may and june and uh
is she a good lambada dancer can't imagine her being a
but didn't feel like she taught it any different significantly differently than when vivian and jeff taught it mean cause they do it
real basic and real simple
different than brazilians do it
mean don't know what those brazilian women are doing
what are they doing
but their hips are like
are they going are they going like really fast mean are they going one two three
mean
one two three
first you had this wide sway of their hips this way and then it's like they're coming mean they're beating me like this don't even know how you can do that you're dancing with them they're beating you just like this
using their hands like that
using their pelvic bones
wow
mm
right here
sort of like tahitian dancers or something
you know close
but tell you
but anyway you know they weren't teaching it that way
you know the ballroom people don't do it that way
but that's what want to learn
don't don't they teach don't they teach you to go one two three one two three one two three like that or do they go like really fast like that
well sue swing mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate and the same thing with jeff and vivian
viv yeah
it was just jeff and
but that's cause it's for s it's for people who can't move their hips right mean it's for basic you know this is a beginning lambada class or intermediate
don't know why they did it that way mean it seems to me if they're gonna teach it like what you do
or what they teach and what happens socially could be two different things you know
mean brazilians definitely don't hm do it like that
should want to go should check it out like that cause it's fun
mean after f mean
are you do they still teach at bahia on sunday night
oh yeah in fact would have gone today if it wasn't for my back
well finally found some people there can dance with so that helps
do you need a partner
to go there
besides you mean if you're a guy if if you're a woman mean those guys'll be all over you swear it
don't say that
run along now
harold's in the room
dear
you could come too
well don't necessarily mean in a bad way even though i'm sure there are a few there i'm not dancing with guys all can say is the women aren't all over me darn
but
but remember like went there with this person it's kind of funny th this person did not want to dance so she's just gonna watch so every once in a while i'd get up and dance and it's like when i'd come back mean there was some guy there sitting in my chair
every time got up i'm thinking god these guys don't waste any time mean you turn your back and there's somebody moving in
mean don't know if they
maybe harold you should come with me
why so can find
learn some lam lambada
find some girls with empty chairs next to em
maybe should go with miles
oh did
you guys could be partners
did
what
well don't know if told you told you that story about that woman who uh went after that guy there told you that story right was there sunday three four weeks ago uh after the class is over w over with i'm sitting down at a table there's a woman from who was in the class and two men sitting to my right is a table with two women there they had apparently just come from oba oba on the last night
oh think you told me
the last night
like well they were attractive women the one had on a real real short skirt anyway there was this guy in his fifties out there dancing by himself and the woman was just looking at him making eyes then she went out there got on her knees in front of him in this skirt that's this short takes her hands and goes along his toes and then up and is just doing like that figured
oh they must know each other
very well in fact
mhm
gross
that's what assumed and they did that for the whole dance and mean she was d all kind of suggestive stuff and touching him and everything people would like cheering and clapping go for it and all this kind of thing the the song ended the guy set down at another table and she set down
at a
at the table with her woman friend they never danced again the rest of the evening
hm
this is like
so was thinking this woman's sitting about as far away from me as jamie is and was thinking hm this is interesting wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her no sooner did think this thought guys were over there
what you didn't ask her to dance
t miles he's just in daze
well was still trying to figure out
ly they must know each other mean why wasn't he sitting at her table
you mean you werestill thinking about it
anyway this guy
mean he comes over there immediately afterwards
the same guy who got his the same guy who's
it's just some random guy
or just some random guy
a random guy who was like sitting about where you are
he was sitting there there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are and then these two women are sitting here so uh he comes over there and is talking with that woman don't know about what but then like ten minutes later she and her friend are over at their table and then twenty minutes later they were kinda like all over each other you know kissing et cetera et cetera and was thinking it looks like these people aren't going home alone tonight
gosh
but just thought that
wonder they forbid this dance
so
oh my god what a story well maybe shouldn't go there then
maybe you shouldn't
it it it was interesting
went there before it was fine it was really fun
you were there before
went out there before
oh
without even telling harold
without telling me
you knew if was going out dancing
oh oh did
remember a few months ago used to go out dancing every now and then
hmm don't remember
well the thing that gets me meet this
to caesar's and stuff
meet this psychotherapist who tells me she's addicted to this dance which th think is a interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use but uh she's married and apparently she's there without her husband she has her wedding ring on and it's like she's with this guy and they're kinda like all over each other and i'm thinking well guess that's her husband
uhoh did you say something
but
but was thinking but the thing is you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything and i'm thinking you know this guy can't really believe that guy's her husband so don't know what's going on here and of course later on find out that's not her husband so i'm thinking you know don't know what's going on here but uh bizarre
gossip
but then she tells me gee don't know what it is about this guy mean i've been trying to tell him don't want a sexual relationship with him and i'm thinking from the way they look when i'd seen them three weeks before it looked to me like they had one i'm thinking you don't do that with
so this is all at bahia
strangers
all this stuff happens at bahia
hunh
to other people mean
well
mean maybe
that was actually very profound
that was maybe you can just go up to a woman and you know do that kinda thing
you you wind up getting punched
mhm
is what'll happen
probably something'll land in your mouth
well it sounds like there you wouldn't be though
what
right
really was wondering what that guy was thinking he must have been j since he didn't know her that must have been quite a shock
that was really weird that sounds really weird
mean you're y y fifty year old guy and some twentyyearold woman comes up doing that to you uh what do you think
think you think you better go back to your table fast
right
apparently
i'll f i'll tell you when i'm fifty what you think okay
mhm
what
that'll be weird when you're fifty wonder what you'll look like
body's fifty don't worry about it
oh okay ha ha ha la lala lala
oh well ten o'clock look like it's bedtime for some folks here
actually it's pretty much bed time for me soon
hm
well that was good ice cream what kind of ice cream was that
bud's
pralines and cream what is it called
but what flavor
uh pecan praline
praline
p
or something like that
ay
do you have a particular um use for the red peppers
as opposed to the yellow or green peppers
no it was all salad peppers
it's all salad peppers
mhm
in that case will use a yellow pepper for this evening
oh fabulous peter
would you like to string the beans
what can do sure
oh it smells like that stuff
know it's kind of smelly isn't it
mhm
but got it at a reputable market
well let's see a threeperson salad bowl
these aren't particularly stringy
hunh
they aren't particularly stringy
oh then just snap em
that probably looks like a threeperson salad bowl
i'll just and put em and put them
hunh
man that's a big hunk of fish
where do you want em put
shit it's a huge
are they just going on that or
uh you wanna put em in a colander and then wash em there's a colander oh it's gone oh here it is um around the corner there got fishy hands my god these are enormous
oh oh see we have two big ones instead of good good good okay now how much do you guys each want like half of that
or will you eat more or if you'll eat
nah
if you'll eat more than that
then i'll cook the whole thing if not then i'll make ceviche with the leftovers what do you think
this is a big fucking fish roy
what what what
do you want half half of one of these or more than that
could eat one of those
you could
hm
well but won't
then guess
mean
ay
divide it in half
well don't
then i'll
what you oughta do though mar cook all the fish
hm
cause well we won't use it if you don't cook it now
well was gonna make ceviche with the leftovers
oh alright that sounds good
so you can eat about that much peter
which size
there's a bad smell in here
that size
hmm
there is
could but i'm i'm also capable of eating lots of stuff
it's the smell of fish the smell
oh okay well let's make the whole thing then
of fish is in the fridge
microwave oh god
ay um
w ah okay we're gonna have like dietetic style fish
hope that's acceptable
you'll probably want me to wash this stuff
silly me do you want you could use the lettuce washer
cause pete's using the colander
where's the lettuce washer
you know the salad spinner thing creole seafood seasoning
see how hard we work
that's right
to feed our guests
i'm really impressed
where is that salad spinner here it is
dollar ninetyeight
possibly the most spurious device ever invented
oh think it they're great do you have a salad spinner
they're cool
is this like something you had when you were young in your own family
it's brand new oh shit
don't think they ever did they actually exist back then
hey bud
and they probably didn't have to wash their salads back then because they didn't know what was on them
yeah they weren't crawling with disgusting pesticides
conceptual pesticides
whatever
pesticides of the mind
what should fry this fish in
could beg your indulgence my dear that might slip in past you here
you can sure okay so did we decide we do or do not want potatoes
think potatoes are excessive think we have enough food here
peter
um that's fine
ay
potatoes
we have um
we're having like salad and fish
unhunh and gre green beans
we can make um garlic bread or something
oh that sounds fun
ay
we could have a little garlic bread
have the ideal makings for garlic bread right here
garlic bread and butter
right well actually have trader joe's whipped garlic bread spread
oh boy
so we can dispense with the garlic and the butter
right
right it's all
that goes right along with the the cajun spice mix
know
know it's just like well we could've gone out
hm
but wanted it to be home made
you know
right flavors of the evening
w it will be the spray on
just add food
spray on
spray on olive oil oh boy
woo
is it really
uh yes it's uh it's really icky
how bizarre
but i'm gonna cut this up so can fry it
how come like the bread crumbs weren't already attached to the fish or the pan
or something
well probably could've bought it that way
but you know said want it to be homemade you know something special
well at least they are uh like already breaded
hm
mean crumbed and in the jar
they're working on breeding prebreaded red snapper

on fish farms
have you heard about these horrific uh new genetic developments in in um food livestock
yno like what
like they're they're trying to breed ho ho they're trying to breed like a forty foot long tube chicken
you mean so that they can go right from that to chicken mcnuggets
they're like they're like yeah and it has
it has n it has no basically no body bones except a spine
yuck
to con vey the nerves from one end to another
oh no who's doing this
this is like
davis
this is like some kind of horrific nightmare read about this
this
this is tube chickens
that's horrible
that is the worst
that's really true
it's just awful who wants to eat it
think i'll dip these in egg
course
you know the early man probably said the same thing about the first domestic chicken
you know
can you imagine they're taking this beautiful jungle fowl and they're leaving it in a box that's gross
right
oh wonder if it's this horrible
is there something fishy that smells
think it's just residual um
residual fish smell from the smelly fish
fish smell from the potent red snapper
well it'll be unpotent in a minute not to worry let me see what was in here for there's nothing worse than staring like a dope at your own refrigerator um oh an egg god damn it what'd you do you son of a bitch
threw a green pepper down your blouse
you threw a green pepper down my shirt
thought it was funny
hilarious
i'm laughing
got quite a giggle out of it
um
um
did you dispense with the uh tomatoes that had sitting in here in a fit of household efficiency
these guys
those yes
okay egg one egg will do so my mom didn't catch any fish
mhm
up north she said rotten luck
where were they fishing like in lakes or
um
rivers
think
or what
um at the mouth of rivers on the coast of oregon
oh
oh my oops too late
they have some
so like what are they catching salmon and stuff
or what
unhhunh
some guy who who knows a good thing when he's on to it calls them
see
says oh the fish are running don't you want to come up here and blah blah blah b
pay me zillions of dollars to
you know
right
pay me
unhunh
pay me you know eighty dollars a day to run my boat
right
catch fabulous salmon and they have it canned
unhunh
you know they eat it when they're up there and guess they have some frozen
right
but they have it canned and
unhunh
put it in our stockings for christmas
aw
isn't that great
it's nice for them they have some recreation with it
but no salmon in your stockings this year hunh
spend their va
well they have already done it so
oh
mean this was another trip
this is the next trip
in fact they were supposed to go up in um more you know environmental thing they were supposed to go up at the end of august when they usually run and fish weren't running this year you know it's like everywhere nothing's doing what it's supposed to anymore anywhere
mhm
that's why that whole mountain climbing expedition was screwy
what mountain climbing expedition was that
the one that we were part of
the expedition we went on in nepal
oh that
in nepal
unhunh
um
what was the problem
was supposed to be
supposed to be perfect weather
right in between the yeah perfect weather and all that stuff
unhunh
they ended up getting early winter storms or late monsoon storms or whatever
whatever
that's
it was atypical weather
mhm
you know everywhere we've been in the past several years everybody's talking about how the weather just isn't normal
that's true that's definitely been the case in indonesia for quite a few years
mhm really
really
well like when was living there for the couple of years it was the rainy season was all off you know it rained during the dry season and was dry during the rainy season
oh really
stuff like that yeah
gee
really really dry they were having a drought while was there
don't know mean don't know if our drought here will ever break wonder if this is just isn't
this is it
hm
the new weather for southern california
well they they claim that there's these cycles and that we're in the the middle of a normal cycle don't know how true that is
well
thanks
r really we read this great book called the end of nature
ew sounds wonderful
by this guy this um you know
bill mckibben
twentyeightyearold harvard guy
right
who lives out in the woods a la thoreau
mhm
anyway smart and uh it's called yeah it's called the end of nature and it's just really a scary book you know there's no natural world left
right
all the natural world was gone in nineteen seventyfive
his premise is basically this
now
that um as soon as the world hit a point where there was no more objectively pristine land
unhunh
when you know they found pollution on top of mount everest
right mhm
at the very bottom of the ocean
right
well that's it
mhm
man has had some effect on the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe
right
so in principle the concept of nature as a system inside of which man lives is over
mhm right
then in practice since then which was fifteen years ago
mhm
man has had such dramatic impact on what we used to think of as nature that that the only way to coexist with nature it's no longer nature the quasi religious overarching ordering principle
right
inside of which mankind lives
wordsworthian nature
mhm
uh you know w a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force over and above ourselves to order the universe forget all that
mhm
woo that's spicy
it's now
shit
you know the world is gonna be kept in order by the same people that brought you
you know
the atomic bomb
right
all that stuff right
right
which just doesn't sound like a very practical proposal
wow
you know the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in europe and america
the dodo
are now entrusted with
maintaining what's there
the rest of the natural world
maintaining the entire globe for the rest of time
mhm right
t likely
mhm
so that was his basic premise and then he goes on for the rest of book to absolutely
then it gets really depressing
heartlessly
oh good
oh gee
heartlessly debunk
you haven't heard nothing yet
all of the you know wateryeyed new age uh various theories of
gaia and all that stuff
of how it might not be that way
right
you know so
unhunh
forget it forget it forget it
right
we're fucked
mhm
well read it in the new yorker and thought oh no one of those new yorker articles you know yuck
right
it was really read the whole thing which is pretty rare well my my
so mean but his premise is not that mankind can't survive on earth
right
his question is
it's just it's a whole different earth
can mankind spiritually survive
right
in a metaphysical world in which it is patently obvious that man is the highest active principle
mhm
you know outside of completely faithbased belief in god you know which is irrespective of any relationship to nature
mhm
there is now absolutely nothing in the world to which we are beholden and he w his question was what impact is this gonna have on the
sort of fucks up the animists
cultural growth
right
of of the human species
mhm
do we even want this
right
do we want to be the guy in charge of the world
unhunh
on the other hand isn't he saying its too late
well he is kind of saying its too late
so
this is why its such a depressing book
right
he's saying we already did it and we haven't even thought about
so much for culture
whether we wanted to do it or not
right
this is typical
you know
and then it gets down to s you know mean that brings into play other people's remarks like you know the w it's all fine and good for us in this generation
let's cook those
so like
to talk about saving the whale
rinse them or something wash them
did
wash them
did you want them broken smaller or
oh think they're good like that
ay
are they good
that's good alright
yeah
you know saving the whale or saving uh the polar bear
right pandas
or making sure there's enough grizzly bears that's fine
mhm
but but implicit is that at any point in time anytime in the future that man the collective you know group
mhm
or even individual special interests decide yeah fuck the whales
right
they're out of there bango
mhm
so anyway interesting book read it because of this project you know
which project
the animal kingdom project
oh okay don't think know about that project
it's a thing i'm doing for disney
so is that why you went to africa
such a scumbag
so
he's going back to um
so he
nepal and india too when november make me
those are not all related languages
they aren't
what
they they just all happen to be in southeast asia
oh
that's why
ilocano's in the philippines right
right
have a neat book don't know if you've seen
what's cebuano
it's in the philippines too
it's on the island of cebu
oh of course
figure that one out
can't it's a department store in tokyo
um

power and gold
power and gold
power and gold it's all about
moslems
jewelry traditions
hm unhunh
of the archipelago of indonesia and the philippines
right oh that sounds great
do you wanna see it
it was at the county
i'll be back
oh it was like this
the
an
exhibition
an exhibition thing
oh it's right here
oh that sounds great
mhm it was neat
did you you did you oh no you never went to jakarta
ay cause there's in the national
jakarta no
in the national museum they have a gold room that has all this gold stuff
oh god
it's really neat
you mean not made out of gold just
oh
mean it's this it's called the gold room
well aren't you neat look at those little ends all wrapped up in that plastic bag
well or do you like should they go somewhere where they they recycle or turn into compost
um
or
we don't have a compost pile yet
so it just goes in the trash like this
that's part of my
which is where
landscape thing garbage is underneath if you can save the bag you can turn it inside out and save it
oh okay
it's okay but you don't have to
this is this is there's already plastic bags in there so
i'll put these on the dining room table
there's already a
just oh
anyway
mm hey that carrot's good
it's got it's really pretty
well that's good
it goes island to island system by island system
are we ready to eat should start food
oh yeah let's definitely um
make food
of these
um they go in how about that that looks good
alright
have that and have another one that's a museum catalog called art of the archipelago think that's what it's called which has indonesian and philippine architecture in it
unhunh
don't know if you've seen either of those
no
they're kind of neat
these p he he in here has some theories drawing at least art historical parallels
what am doing
between motifs of the
should steam these
people of asam
unhunh
uh with with mostly batak and dayak and
oh really
stuff yeah
oh that's interesting
actually when you see it
unhunh
when you see them
right
you can imagine pretty clearly
unhunh
some connection anyway interesting hunh
that looks like enough salad
oh get it mar went out to put the you put the water on the plants is that what was going on
what
you were watering with that is that what you were doing
that's good
perfect water
unhunh
actually you know i'd love to do gray water
mhm
here but
it's illegal
it's illegal
really how rude
isn't that retarded
isn't that weird
it is they just built a a great big gray water processing center at the laundromat in the complex where live
oh
it's like right outside our back door there's all these huge machines and stuff
great m
that like filter it and all and then it they're going to like pump it into their watering system for the apartment complex
gray water systems are local to mean you get your own you don it's not like a big system somewhere
right yeah
you get your own gray water system
right yeah
but this is like
but it's a complex
right cause this is this apartment complex and there's the laundromat and they just dump the water from that and everything
well laundry's the best way and showers guess
the best way
to get gray water
right well would think you wouldn't want to think what might go down in the sink and stuff
you wouldn't want to what well guess guess it's more that it's not that you don't want it on your lawn it's that you don't want it sitting around before it goes on your lawn
right right
stuff from the sink
cause the stuff from the sink would be great for your lawn if it could get right out there
right yeah but then it would be sitting there sort of decomposing or doing its thing all over the lawn instead of in a nice little compost pile
so that's
well mm
well not if you were careful mean you know if you if you if you didn't have if you were really careful about your dishes
right
scraped em off
it was just runoff
mhm yeah well that would be good cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with
but yeah actually you know zeke the sheik is a local you know the guy whose compost pile blew
oh no don't know about this
didn't you hear about him
it it caught fi here finish these up it caught fire and um he he used the compost from the um place next door that was a big big big cemetery and here you wanna butter these
the grass clippings
mhm
huge cemetery
they would mow their lawns
he would take the grass clippings
he asked em if he could have the grass clippings for like fifteen years
mhm
so he had this
how many just make three of em
mhm
is that what's happening
or however long the butter lasts um
so he had
and it blew
a forty foot tall compost pile
unhunh
it started to combust you know internally
right just sort of naturally
just like dickens mhm
spontaneously
ah now what am doing with this
so just like this butter them it's already open
ay
and split em
ay
you didn't even split em
presplit
those are left over they're probably yeah there might be mold think they're okay
oh fine
mm
mm delicious
mm
nutty sesame or what is this
sourdough
poppy seed
are they
is the mold
oh yeah
oh
oh
how are the beans
sourdough how are the beans great yummy
is this like
delicious
uh
checking for an expiration date
was just wondering what all the what all the black things were in it
mold
oh
right
shall do something civilized
like clear the table
or are we just gonna barbarian it out
why don't you clear the table unless we want to eat outside
it's dark how will we see what we're eating
candles
you wanna eat inside or outside pete
don't care outside's fine
let's eat outside ju but you still have to clean off that table cause it's grody
which table this table here
the table outside
have to clean the table outside
mhm it's dirty
little outside cleaning
so wash it with that cloth or something
wash it wipe it down
ps sorry did get you
pe
thought was gonna get you
this away
shit beans beans beans
ps shit oh love green beans and they are so good leftover with lemon and garlic
so these are just the spices that are black and green and stuff
guess where's the black don't see any black
well don't know well it's maybe just the light
it's kinda think it's oregano
guess it's just really dark it's oregano and stuff yeah
dark oregano that famous black oregano
alright
it's like purple basil purple basil
right
so should just finish it all off make this really decadent and rich and
mhm yeah get rid of it oh look a little lemon from the tree ew they're still kinda yucky you know we came back from a we had to go to the ritz carlton out in laguna for a event and w we were gone what four days you know really relaxing weekend you know it was really great and i'd had this i'd had a particularly stupendous time because had to be a wife most of the time but part of the time got to be a worker and do the really fun work so it was really great
unhunh
had a great time and uh we're pulling up and see this girl who i'd never seen before sort of dart out of our driveway
unhunh
stand there and watch us pull in and she goes like this like oh my god i'm gonna getting caught and said hi can help you
you know and she goes and you know of course it's this long drive so probably look like total hell
right
she goes oh um was just getting some lemons
said oh yeah who are you
she goes oh i'm your next door neighbor
she said first she said kenneth said could have some who's this guy this old guy across the street
unhunh
so roy had said to him if you ever want lemons you know go ahead and and have em
right
then he said she said oh kenneth said could have some lemons
right
said he did
she goes yeah and said oh and she goes do y you don't mind do you and said well yeah in fact do mind cause thought the lemon tree was dying didn't see any lemons on it
unhunh
cause she said you wouldn't mind if came back and got a whole bag full would you
right
said yeah
there's like one lemon left on this tree that can reach
right
you know
unhunh
roy's about to go to africa and so i'd never you know i'd have to get a step ladder out to pick my own lemons and stuff give me a break
have to use a um what this abrasive sponge to clean that table off
ay why is it grody
well it just doesn't come off very easily
should make like tartar sauce or something really decadent
what's this in this squirt bottle
um windex
i'm gonna use some of that
does tartar sauce go with with cajun spices
well we could make
mean that doesn't matter suppose it just
oh you know what we have this neat island mango sauce
fields
mm
chutney sauce
chutney
that would be good
have tons of chutney
well that sounds good
chutney
do you save these things
um think that one'll save yeah
oh okay i'll just put it in the sink
what are those little things called small plastic
containers
reuseable containers
right
guess mm
oh this looks yummy
that's really good little salty mm
mm yeah
oh guess we ought to put those in the oven if we're gonna eat em hm
it says chicken livers on it
it's amazing what happens if you keep it in the fridge long enough

oh now does this guy look original
llenar is to fill
show gun
that's what thought and
whoo hoo hoo actually
um
that's not a bad black and white all honesty
is remanar a verb or did just imaginate imagine it that
just
in your dreams
assumed that if
you made it up from a noun
to remain a verb to remain
unhunh i've never heard it no
wonder the kids always giggle when say that word
whoo hoo hoo
they love to
they love to point it out when like i'm always you know ah i'll do things like
smacking her
you n didn't bother to look up the infinitive
accidentally i'll i'll put an el or a la in front of a verb that sounds masculine or feminine cause i'll forget you know
well that's expected
i'll put up ten sentences on the board right
i'll tell them alright sit down you know had to get really tough in this last week the first week played with them all week long which was really stupid because they got worked
the second week they were just like and so had to scream at them
and it was really awful cause felt horrible about it cause had to do shit like they have a conduct chart conducta right and all week long threatened them with it you know
but have you ever put anybody's name on it
al terminar la semana en viernes yo estoy vayando poner las letras alla
para exelente eme for mal
or be for bien
hm
que es mas o menos
es exelente pero es mas o menos right
funny
at the end of the week this last week like five of them got for mal

all week
like withheld recess from s several kids on on thursday

that's the new thing with all the moms no candy
but not in the houston school system
candy
nn
mean
t
come here to santa fe
right
have an apple
here at the
at the private school in town
well these kids
they
care
took us a while to get our kids jolly ranchers
mean their parents are aren't
right
these kids are so mean their parents are so disinterested
in them
th yeah and their education because these are
oh believe it
these are parents that have come from places like el salvador
columbia
well
they have never learned english
they have never been educated
mhm
they look at you and they
they're like i'm just waiting for my kid to grow up so that he can work construction with me
you know mean a couple more years
he'll be ready
they're in fourth grade
they do shit like i yeah mean they do stuff like
oh yeah
they they'll come and they'll take their kids off
you know half way through school to mexico and never come back and they would like have couple parents who still keep s sending messages home with their folks saying please you know in spanish call the oficina you need to fill out this form because your kid
can't have free lunch like for my first week there had like five dollars to my name or something like that gave it all to the kids all week long
mm
because their parents
big mistake
were too lazy to come
and fill out the stupid form you know an application
that takes two weeks to process
that takes two weeks to process mean how do you explain that to th
but is the form in english
they have a form in spanish also
well even if it's in spanish maybe they can't read
well
mhm
that's very probable you know but um i've no cause i've received notes back
grapenuts
especially from this one girl you know dear and esteemed teacher
hunh
you know in m in spanish my child you know has already filled out this form and
there was one situation
she's sleeping
there's this little girl annalisa
so we can decide about
that doesn't
speak a word of english and every time try to get her to say anything in english
cause made the whole class learn like good morning good bye can go to the bathroom can stand up can go to the er time to go to the cafeteria and the office you know certain st terms that related to school and she like you know tried to get her to say hello and she'd be like
puedo no puedo i'd be like yes you can just say
hello hello annalisa
that's what she does she gets real embarrassed and she just giggles like a goofball
turns bright red
she she does well she would if you know if her skin weren't like really dark brown she'd probably be bright red
how funny man
you know you you can't really tell when they blush it's very unusual but um her mom like it was a horrible situation where last week wasn't there on thursday cause had to fill out all this stupid n n you know had to do all this shit just in order to get my position secured there with the bureaucracy so they let me off for a day and there was a sub and what annalisa claims and her mother claims is that on that day they brought back the application for free lunch all filled out and that the sub took it
ah
right
oh for goodness sake
so you know find this out a week later kept bugging annalisa t you know did you bring the form in did you fill it all out why don't you get another one and search my desk and it's not there and keep calling the office and sending notes and they keep calling me on the their stupid intercom system that you can hardly understand
mm you have to tell students never get give a tutor anything anything ever not even homework they wouldn't let us give homework to the high school tutors
know
because they just they lose it
they don't care
well
they they don't give a shit about anything
know
hadn't thought of that at th at that point last week let me out of here
unless they've just begun subbing
well this woman
because then they're like
what are we gonna learn today
see i'm originally a teacher but
guess can teach math
you know they come in with that attitude and they go i've always wanted to teach math
w what are we on
it's gonna be great
you know and you're saying uh we're on uh
square root of pi uh
they look at you and they go the what
so they don't know what the hell they're doing uh
pi
why don't we go out and run some laps
didn't bring any pie with me today
you know
they they don't know what they're doing
don't think we can have pie till lunch kids
see it's like distorted they don't know what they're doing
well this lady is apparently an old sub who like all the teachers know and apparently she's very reliable
ah
so whether the paper got in or not don't know but um
you can't go and ask her
well k kept calling the office and saying do you have this form and they'd tell me no and finally went in there on thursday and i'm like look
where is it
this kid you know she most of the time doesn't have money have to give it to her myself
you know she she's deprived of lunch do you can do you have a form for her
they don't have extra lunches left over at the end of the day that they will give away
w on file no
you gotta go in and talk to the principal about this
coop this is a raging bureaucracy and there's nothing that can do have found that out when you wait until you hear what th all they've done with my class you'll just be disgusted but
fourth grade
this girl
ugh
um and so go in there and i'm like well can you tell me whether the the form is on file cause n realize it takes two to three weeks to process but just tell me whether it's on file because if not want her to have another one now and the woman's like can't do that there's a privacy code or whatever there's a privacy act
can't access the file like
god
what kind of fucking law is that
that you're gonna tell me that you know this kid might have to wait
another month and a half to e have any lunch because you can't access you know her form
what's the deal
unbelievable
they're just giving think it sounds like to me they're giving you a lot of shit for no reason
well they really are picking on the fact that i'm new like y uh it's really annoying
the fact that you're new uh uh
that
would would go further than that
i'm not certified and
it's like the teachers
coop this last week
can't
first they're like first only had fifteen kids right and the legally you have to have eighteen rules has it that you have to have at least eighteen right so i'm the only permanent sub i'm the only teacher who's not experienced who's not certified who just started teaching all these other teachers are old hands mean they've all been at it for at well chris is the least experienced besides me but still he's you know he's had his certification and he's had a year and stuff he's real good at it so they do shit like first they tell me like find out accidentally from the other teachers the principal doesn't even tell me first she hires me n like the friday before school starts and expects me to get my room ready and then and then find out on thursday in the first week of school that might lose my job
you told me
come friday yeah and and then th so come into class and they've put like all these thirdgrade students in there did tell you about that
it's really annoying what they've done to meet the l the
they split it third and fourth
little technicality that they have to meet yeah they just split the whole thing
challenging yeah
it's well it's something
it's twice as much work for you
it's something for experienced teachers it's not for me you know it's like really hard for me because you know and then
you have to n
then
that's what was doing when was student teaching had split fifth sixth
well they didn't even give me any texts coop mean was the only teacher in the whole school who did not have textbooks you know
mhm
because they were fucking me around so hard so then on the on friday have eighteen kids
i'm like great you know and all these teachers are coming in and saying well my child is on your role but i'm gonna keep him in my class you know
mm
have these three thirdgraders you know but the shitty thing is that they pick what the teachers do is they go oh well this this kid is bad behaved mean he's he's really stupid i'll just send him over to the new instructor
of course
so they s so these are
of course
the kids that receive are the three thirdgraders of the lowest education
that nobody wants
the worst conduct right and so th
meanwhile in the principal's office they're telling me
sharon standing in front of the class going
aw sometimes i'm like that
while these little kids kinda senorita flinn
hee hee hee hee hee
oh miss flinn miss flinn miss flinn
you know towards the last couple of days i'm like put up a list of rules and all day long
went back to the rules
do not pull on my clothes
and they get up out of the chair
they come up to me miss flinn miss flinn and i'd walk over by the rules and i'd point to number two and i'd just look at them
they knew what number two was don't get out of your seat without permission
you know so they'd look at me and they'd go
god
they'd go back to their chairs
on the last day that was there like
it was so awful
because
boy you're a hard ass
had to become a hard ass
the people w
all the teachers were telling me
could be worse
you're too nice you're too nice your kids are gonna take advantage of you and they were th they k
they came to where they'd be talking the whole time during the assignment
ah
i'd be up at the board they'd be i'd turn around they'd go
ah
hee hee hee cause they didn't think was serious
finally got to the point where you know every day i'd have em put their heads on the table for ten minutes
hunh
you know with the with their eyes closed
time out quiet time
finally got to where withheld recess
on the last day kept th four kids after school
you know but you can only actually keep them over for like five minutes cause they have like buses to catch and stuff
well i'm telling you withholding goodies works because
but if you give them rewards
well gave them st gave sticker you know to the k to the kids and put excellent
give stickers to the kids and the ones that got good grades that got one hundreds and ninetyeights and ninetysixes put their papers up on the board
well there are other things you can do besides um um you know you can make up goodies you don't have to spend money on goodies you can have like you can make these little um do they have a laminating machine in the school
t in the school but in this other lovely place
well
make these little passes or something that say one
one free lunch with the teacher or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime get to sit with my friends at lunch or what think up whatever little privileges like that um if there's anything in the classroom that they really like to do
have that be a privilege that nobody can do unless they have this pass and then give those passes out for good behavior at the end of the day
have an idea choose the mister samuel way of teaching
take them by the hair
boom heads against each other
or you can walk up to the chalkboard and you get really good so you go and you practice on the weekends
get chalk from the chalkboard
you just peg it at their face
you know
remember
you and you practice finally that man was fired man it took them how many years
they fired him
oh mister samuel
he k sh god
he was the most
man he threatened little kids
we'd all be sitting in a circle and it'd be current events time we'd all be sitting there
he was harsh
one little kid eli goodman would just give him he was just talking eli was just talking mister samuel must have had a really bad day
he came
alright you little shit i'm gonna throw you against this wall and he threatened it he threatened to throw the kid against the wall and we all heard it and we all
went home and told your parents
freaked out no because w we were too scared to do anything and we would and our parents would go oh he's a great guy and they'd go and visit him and he would put on the bullshit and
he'd be fine
no one believed the kids you know he was a man who would walk up to two little boys that were talking and grab their hair and actually bang their heads together
what a guy
he picked ken romig up once by the hair remember that
ken who's like was actually very wellbehaved you know and and really smart student went on to be one of those overachievers
you know just yanked him up by his little blond hairs
by the hair yep
we were all like
oh
but he won't do anything to the girls if they give him backrubs
that's right that's right
mister samuel had like the most
what a jerk man
unethical
classroom can ever remember
he was a fool he was an absolute fool
remember the the students
remember muffin being terrified that she was going to be put in his class
his daughter his daughter actually admitted it to me saw sally samuel
admitted what
who is pregnant and has about you know let's not discuss it but was like um
what did she admit
how's your father
was kind of crude but was like so what is your father doing right now is the man dead yet
was just very kind she goes well he he got fired and and said oh really now
that's a surprise
que lastima
the guy that he threatened to throw against the wall was put forward a year eli graduated a year before did see didn't understand that
it was a hush hush deal
didn't make any sense it w it was really weird
well he'd like
eli's parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class
his classroom was like
that was the only way to do it
doubt
crazy
doubt that man was insane definitely insane
hey coop what was gonna tell you about that really frustrates me is that uh that the people principal and stuff they say to me oh well what you do with those thirdgraders you know is you just like take them and put them you know with one of the smarter fourthgraders who's very verbal
uh
and wellbehaved and you have them work as a team you know so that the fourthgrader can help the thirdgrader but that's bullshit because that just teaches the thirdgrader with the lesser intelligence that that he's worthless you know that he can't learn stuff on his own
it's not no it's not you can put them in teams like that but you don't put one with one you put like two fourthgraders with how many thirdgraders do what's the ratio of thirdgraders to fourthgraders
but they're not
you mean so they don't feel singled out
w have like five thirdgraders
or what
have like t twentytwo kids
ay so you have fifteen fourthgraders and five thirdgraders
na uh no have like seventeen fourthgraders and five thirdgraders
all you have is twelve kids
what
you only have twelve kids
seventeen
oh okay
fourthgraders
so then what you do is you sprinkle the fifthgraders out evenly and you make the fourthgraders take the responsibility for teaching them
thirdgraders
you engrain in them that it's their responsibility to help those little kids that's what did
have been
but
it works
can you can you say it's part of your grade
as long as it's
part of your
oh yes
corporate or
you bet
what do you call it
well the thirdgraders
you tell them that their ability to cooperate is being graded
coop well the thirdgraders are just like
y they're getting a grade in cooperation
you know except for a couple who who are real smart
darn that would be so hard
feel like uh you know they're incapable mean th they just feel like
well the fourthgraders try and lord it over em too
and the fourthgraders will try to just like give them the answers
there's nothing else you can do about it
it's hard for me to keep track of that you know i'll be like don't give them the answers
standing over
want you to help them understand but don't just give them the answers
it takes a long time to teach em how to work together
if can't teach these kids you know go around to the thirdgraders try to teach them individually what a noun is
it'll start to happen by january sharon
mean it takes a very long time it's not easy to do
i'm not gonna be there until january
have have you explained to them like the speech about making mistakes is part of life that speech and
what's the other speech the other speech is
i've given them everything
um don't give away don't give away the answers because you're d denying them of learning
mhm
if y if you put it to them in a very simple way and they get it and they kind of go yeah
well what you want to do is
when you have them in groups working on something
have have
it shouldn't be multiple choice it shouldn't be
it isn't
something easy they should they should have to
write it out
have some discussion going on like
give them something to work on that there is no answer to
but the other fourthgraders it's like
that is just opinion they'll learn just as much
you know they don't really wan they don't want to help the kids they they wa you know they're done and they want to play and they get upset with me
if expect them to help the thirdgraders
help em to learn the basics
tough
they don't have the patience
too bad
this is the funny one
or the psychology
to learn how to teach the kids well when you're subtracting you bring the one over and then that becomes ten and then you have to cross it out it becomes a nine
god
then you bring the one over
couldn't do it
you know
couldn't do it
these the thing is that the teachers that had these thirdgraders before and a lot of the fourthgraders really failed as teachers cause they didn't teach them
diddly
jack
they should have learned that in the second grade
in the in the second grade learned my times tables in the third grade knew th
fourth grade was
had them memorized up until twelve
fractions failed
these kids can't do their times tables
the fourthgraders even
well they've just
you know
they've been
have one student
you know
who knows his times tables up until ten
wait
they
hey
the teachers have just been passing them along
wait a minute neither did
didn't know them either didn't know times tables till s like fifth grade only cause was a dufus but
well were
it was because you were a lazy butt
could not could not do fractions could not do fractions and mean with samuel as a teacher who wants to tell them who wants to go up to this man and say have a problem
you didn't really have mister samuel did you
oh hell yeah
oh thought you got out of being in his class
unhunh had him my whole fourthgrade year and then there was a possibility the following year that he was going to teach fifth grade
cause our fifthgrade teacher was leaving
so all of us were like
shitting in our pants going
please no we just we lucked out man but we got missis lindberg who was like the first granola woman ever met
granola woman
but but to try and and talk me out of believing in murphy's law by offering a miracle as a replacement that doesn't d work
well you're right think they're probably flip sides
mean who are you
but i'm
pollyanna
hardly
hardly look where i've come from mean this chapter on heaven an hell it's really interesting
why
used to have this sort of standard line that there were two things got out of my marriage one was a name that was easy to spell and one was a a child that really got me grounded but the fact of the matter is that the marriage itself mean as hellish as it was it's like it pulled me under like a giant octopus or a giant giant shark and it pulled me all the way under and then and there was it was like the silent scream and then then found that was on my own two feet again and it really was what was hell in that that marriage became became a way out for me it was the flip side it's like sometimes you go through things and you come out the other side of them you come out so much better and if hadn't had that if hadn't had
it's not the way with food
what do you mean
what goes in one way
doesn't come out
kay comes out very hellish
very hellish
so what did that have to do
but it's so goodgod k so good going down th mean
what did
there's there's the opposites again
it's it's ma
the food is like all unique
hey
wonderful
it's majorleague yin and yang
heavenly major league
what does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book
well i'm just sort of reiterating could read you some
mean is that allowed
don't want to hear anything out of a book with chapter called heaven and hell
you don't
nkay well then let's talk about our vacation
i'm gonna be closedminded about it
oh dear
but
that's hell
didn't like the book the way the minute looked at it
you didn't
that's cause you
that's because have my own ideas about it guess that i'm pretty comfortable with
ah
don't like re don't like reading books about what other people think about dying and consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff
well
that's
remember remember it in the movie in beetlejuice the handbook for the recently deceased
mean books words mean n they just become handbooks you distill them and use them in your own way
no no don't don't come up with my own ideas about that stuff
where do you get the ideas
thought
where do you get those thoughts
processing what goes on around me
well isn't a book part of what goes on around you
well more from an oblique source you know when you're reading fiction or or articles or history or something like that but but t for me it's very difficult to pickup a book about death that someone's written about death because it's bullshit
well
who knows what death is
what d what what this man has put in the boo you haven't read the book one you haven't read the book so you don't know haven't read the book so don't know
but do know it it's an awfully it's it's an awfully presumptuous thing
but
to sit down and write a book about death
d
when you haven't died
it has it has it has stories in there from from the zen and f it just pools on other different
well the zen can be bullshit too
different sources
mean whoever wrote the book of zen wasn't dead either
well it might all be bullshit
but you g you g you've gotta pull these ideas from your environment and what's gone on before th th the things know most about life and death come from from my grandmother and having gone through all that with her and then it was interesting cause reading did after that substantiated that experience for two months prior to her death did tell you this that she dreamt about um she had this dream of falling off a building down o just like that that cartoon we saw
falling yeah
the animation cartoon
yeah yeah
it was like that and that's what she was dreaming about and then she said that she dreamt about um all of her relatives that had died she wasn't dreaming about anybody who was living but who had died
read that later you know it was much later read that in a book where um people who had technically died and then have been revived saw relatives coming for them
i've read that
course that may be what happens prior to the big the big nothing
so why are you reading a book about dying
don't know
you don't know
have an interest in it
why you're alive why are you reading a book about dying
i've always been interested in it
why mean you know you ask someone why they're interested in electronics and they can probably tell you
well don't know guess it must fo some reason was fascinated with that movie last night with with uh lilian gish and
bette davis couldn't believe these two old don't know wanna say windbags ha but what happens to them here's betty davis mean
sarah
z yeah this incredible film legend and we think of her in jezebel we think of her you know smoking cigarette smoke into the faces of william holden and and the like
don't i've never seen those movies
you've never seen betty davis movie you've heard kim the song betty davis eyes
she's got she got the woman's got a rep
so she she lives and
guess it's j looking at my mother too n
what does that have to do with why you're reading a book on death
i've always been interested in death
why
why
i'm laughing
what is
i'm thinking one thing my mother always used to say when wouldn't go bicycling with my father
pamela you are
she would say
you are
she would say you'll be sorry when we're dead
because you wouldn't bicycling
mm because wouldn't go bicycling with my father
oh so i w it's it's
you know and h bit my tongue the other day because remember you said to deven well really want to spend time with you
then we went to the chalk fair and then he took off with tobias
the chop fair
the chalk
oh
the chalk fair
unhunh
he took off with tobias
is that that that wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today and why did you run off and didn't because remembered that my mother tried to guilt me the same way
so that's why you're interested in death
maybe it's because my parents were old when was young very very young i've always thought it's weird that we've been look down at my body and feel like i'm in a spaceship
just
that's why you're interested in death
n and
just think it's so damn weird we're here
yeah well it is
and was constructed inside of some woman's womb and was burped out
so so you're running you're running down the road all the way to the very end hunh
you're you're you're already standing at the end of the road
trying to figure out what happens there
well n n maybe maybe i'm just eager to get back to where was may
back into the womb
no no maybe maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption
of what of what
of whatever it was was doing before was before my number came up and was told had to come back here
what if what if
unhunh
what if worrying about that
see this is what you told deven
well what if worrying about that has got in the way gotten in the way of you making positive choices for yourself in your life instead of just worrying about w that you're here and making the best out of it
being here is is so illusive sometimes mean illusionary
those are two different words and they mean two different things
well it's illusionary take back what said about illusive
you may be elusive well
mm
but but but to me the whole point is is you have no idea what happens before or after you have no idea you can read books about it and you can talk about it but the most pragmatic thing to do is to just live it
hm
learn the rules of the game play the game
for what
for whatever you want for whatever you want be a doctor or a screen writer or an actress or a philanthropist or an explorer
an explorer
do what you want with the time you have learn give whatever
love
love
love
could love you
could love you while i'm here
don't make light of what i'm saying
think about the kids what are who are who are these kids who are these kids these little seedpods that have been sent our way
well sometimes for me they are a whip and a hairshirt
they're little little little lessons
ah yeah mean sometimes have to be real prep
what
natalie asked me about santa claus today
what did she what did she say
in the laundromat she said mom santa claus isn't mean d is there a for real sa santa claus said a for real santa claus you mean a man who lives at the north pole she said yeah said no and she said well who are the other ones said well they're the spirit of santa claus and they represent santa claus they they're a picture of santa claus
they're santa claus's agents
they're pictures of santa claus is my mike on
unhunh
oh okay
it sure is
you just damn near broke the damn needle there
then she said and then she said well who fills the stockings and kind of said love fills the stockings
oh god pamela
she said she said oh you mean adults
adults who wanna show you how much they care and said yeah adults adults around who love you fill those stockings and said she said but some adults talk about santa claus said that's because they wanna believe in santa claus and that's what told her said wanna believe in santa claus in fact sometimes do believe in santa claus and that that really satisfied her
but thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in june
but what d
thought to myself if she asked me that like on christmas eve
well she must have gotten some sort of a signal somewhere
today in the laundromat
mean what does that have to do with death
well we were talking about death and illusions
the illusions of this life you know
my favorite word when was twelve was paradox
why
because thought any word that was defined mean remember the definition that learned in seventh grade that was paradox seemingly contrary
seemingly
seemingly con and had a hard time with the definition so thought god word that i'm supposed to learn and get this definition and don't even understand the definition
the definition of the word paradox is by design ambiguous chew on this one an ambiguous paradox
is that redundant
well that was age twelve so that was very close to deven's age when sort of bit my teeth into that one
bit your teeth hunh
then yeah
as went
took a bite
is is that like cutting it in the nip
get a little ahead of myself
yeah guess you do
oh god hope this doesn't all sound real stupid
well from from twelve to seventeen then that went from paradox to the invisible interfacing with the visible
hunh
the invisible interfacing with the visible
facing
for everything you see you can look at me and i'm a body you see eyes you see body you see hair you see
get your hands off me
you see all those things right
but there's there's me inside that's invisible
it's not it's it's n it's it's
mean what if what if you took the same spacesuit and you put another spirit into it it would be a different person
it'd say let me out
it would be a different person
you're right
wouldn't be me
right that's right it'd be a different personality
so think it's very fascinating
of course that's a hypothetical how do you know that
it's very interesti
maybe may
maybe
maybe maybe the spacesuit has something to do with with who's inside of it mean you don't know that
wouldn't that be f a fascinating experiment
well no because look genes genetic makeup it's proven and that's part of the spacesuit if you wanna use that that that your genetic makeup largely determines who you are
you mean the chemical bath sit in
as it were
hm sort of dictates how feel about being in this spacesuit
yes right you know and it depends on your brain dolphin level and
my brain dolphin
mm
that's sweet
you know
hunh
depend am yeah yeah lot of it has to do with the with the the r five dollars and ninetyeight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you
we could spend a lot of our life trying to to contradict that
why
well because
it may be a very bad chemical bath
we may
b been put into something that's completely acid to our true essence
but we have no choice in that matter
we spend a lifetime that's right well no apparent choice no choice that we know of
mn yeah hm hm y yeah but but rather than than
mean i'm not i'm not i'm not all bent out of shape about it
but i've just but was thi
you're just really interested in death
my yearning my yearning
my yearning is n maybe not to run ahead and
and and get to the exit as
mean maybe it's the yearning for where was before was born
well how is write reading a book written by some schmuck who thinks he's an expert on death
well he may or may not be a schmuck darryl
anyone who sits down to write a book about death with the hopes of enlightening his fellow human beings is in my book a schmuck
well now them's fightin' words
boy you could
who the hell is someone anyone who's living to sit down and write a book about death
w really
you know it's like it's these this this is the person who falls under that that category of expert that disdain so much know a lot about
maybe he's a very old soul
please
like old king cole
hm well
if he's a very old soul he should keep it to himself
you know felt l after gretchen died it was all rather unfair mean the tides at work just swept over her so quickly and it was like
but really not so quickly it was yeah mean it was something that had started in her a very long time ago
she was gone in less than five months six eight months
disgusting
well you know
remember tyke lived next door to mom
ay two weeks ago i'm watching and david horowitz is going to have this former car radio thief on
it's her boyfriend
her exboyfriend mike he's the one that stole hector's radio
how do you know
well cause well he he was a cocaine addict so he's talking about he you know he's yeah man he's gonna show us you know how not
to protect your car not to get it you know ripped off man cause you know yeah was into it uh let me show you how easy it was he's actually pretty intelligent you know he just uneducated so um yeah hector's radio with it was broken we were gonna s take it out and send it back to the factory to get a new factory radio we never got a chance because the back window was broken and they stole it the radio and you can't send something back to the factory that isn't there anymore
right so he never got his radio
it's really hard
oh shit
so he got another radio this summer
but of course that got ripped off also but never mind
he's having bad luck with that car what i what i what is this
don't know
so you it's obvious now that this guy w this was the one who stole hector's mean nobody came out and told you guess what
confess
oh we knew we knew we figured it had to be michael
oh shit
mhm so mom didn't want me to we had to go see jan last sunday at her house for dinner and or breakfast and mom said n you know don't bring it up to linda don't tell her about mike so b that's like waving a red flag yeah hello tyke did you see mike on
did she
she said sh they were sitting there watching and the next thing she know there's mike on the on and she goes and of course john who's just as bad is sitting there going oh did you see mike your exboyfriend but he's no better he does other goofy things
goofy
little goofy
graft goofy
know
hee sleepy
steali stealing cars but you know it's okay at least it's not car radios it's the whole car
it's the whole car
go big or don't go at all shoot
know it
know
it's amazing no jan talked the whole time in a voice like this
hi mar alina alina i'm so happy to see you

ola ola what'd he call it
oba oba that
what he
oh he called it oho oho
they ca they came and grabbed everybody and got you dancing in the aisles and they were just nice people
they were really happy to be doing it
one of the g the male athletes were incredible but one of the guys his entrance on on to the stage is he comes sliding across on his head and hector of course looks over at me and goes couldn't do that lina otherwise i'd have no hair left
but there was hardly anybody there
it was the matinee the place was completely empty
really
that's why marcia and jim could get up and move
they they thri they feed off of all these
th the friend that was there with them is this older guy with this young chick
she was like a real pill you know
she's sitting there with this hair pulled back in a little ponytail
she's like sitting there and he said would have been here but she was so late and getting her any place on time she's going well had to get ready don't know why
nothing was gonna help her no makeup no nothing cause she's the little girl and he's the older man and he's taking care of me
god
it sounds like the tape made last night and these guys start talking about
you know some you know she's so vulnerable
she's probably like twentysix and she looks thirteen and it's just so
it's like what did they said something like you know what
it's the butterfly you can't catch
i'm like i'm trying not to vomit listening to this
give me break
give me a break
that stupid little bitch she just married daddy to take care of her
they all live down like in del mar w super ritzy area
know what about uh
what
th the other perrizo in this world
oh liza oh god
well
t like did tell you about when mom was having arnold and lisabeth over for lunch finally okay well mom they call up in august and go mean it's daddy's been dead what seven years and finally it dawns on lisabeth that she doesn't see mom that much well it's cause she n know she never calls her right so mom
she just goes feel like you've got a whole other world outside of us like you don't even need us mar and that you have a whole other life
mom said do well
poor lisabeth
you've hurt my feelings and buh
mom's go
maybe she's just kind of dense hunh
well she wants everything on her terms
you know
is she vicious or dense
she's a dope
so
explains that
exactly so t mom said you know she goes when can see you or so mom said
well my next free day's like october fourth so that was when
they set up two months in advance to have lunch so october fourth rolls around
liza had to go do something so they're stuck babysitting cassandra great you know just your big thrill in the world
how old is she now
this little piss ass four five some place around there can't remember ever cause it's just she's such a nightmare to me so anyway mom they had to cancel they m they make arrangements for like couple weeks later and wanted to surprise mom and bring over some nice pastries from la conversation so go into la conversation and picked out all this stuff for uncle arnold and it was just supposed to be mom ruben arnold and lisabeth and was gonna sit down and talk with them and split so i'm driving up to the house and there's a car in front of me and the guy is just like sitting there in the middle of the road and he's not moving and you know wanna park the car
you know and th there's no parking either on one of those sides because it's street sweeping day or something it's like would you move so can come park my car and then realized it's liza and antonio
there's cassandra jumping around jumping around jumping around inside the car nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah
so it turns out that she wouldn't get out of the car with arnold and lisabeth so liza and antonio followed them over there to pickup cassandra and take her for a day in the park but then liza wanted antonio to see mom's house so they go barging in on mar so mom felt obligated to ask those two idiots to lunch also thereby having to invite dear cassandra who we did not want there in the first place cause she's such a little piss ass so the first thing get inside the house and there's cassandra jumping up and down jump jump jump jump jump jump jump and grabbed her and held her down
go
listen you little piss ass this is my house and today you are not going to jump today you're gonna act like a human you got that
she just looks at me
she kind of nods her head
she's terrified
she's going ah shit
auntie lina's here again am leaving so she wants to go out on the balcony
grab her again and go
kids on the balcony you wanna go outside you gotta go downstairs
but you're not going out on the balcony cause knowing you you're gonna fall off
aw
wouldn't that be a pity
oh know so and
f for arnold and lisabeth of course said cassandra you wanna play one bounce off the balcony
hunh
t auntie didn't laugh the little shit
she wouldn't eat her lunch because she wanted dessert dessert comes around mom had cut all the pastries in half cassandra takes five of them she took a bite from each one that was it don't want any more
cause she gets away with it
gets away with it she was taking the silverware and digging it into the table
oh that's cute
said excuse me cassandra
you wanna try that one more time
th those tables are museums could you please chill out in the uh art k art work here
said try it again one more time i'm gonna come over there
i'm gonna take that and i'm gonna dig it into you
meanwhile lisabeth's going
maybe cassandra wants to go outside again
said yeah that's a good spot for her
antonio had on white shoes
i'm sorry
don't care if he is italian
don't care that was the ugliest set of shoes ever saw in my life one of the kids at work said
but alina it doesn't count unless he had a white belt
and he did
he did
don't care if it's a white suit
put something else
he had on a white suit liza had on a um a black suit and then he stands there and tells her how it's not it needs to be baggier here and they're analyz they are so superficial
they are into all this clothing
he has a restaurant or something or what does he do
or wh who is he
he's a waiter he's a waiter at rosa's out there in ontario
which is a very nice restaurant i'm sure but he wants to open his own restaurant someday and he thinks we're gonna finance it
actually thinks cathy and jawahar are or jonathan is cause they're the wealthy ones
tried to explain to cathy that life had changed now
for her
that
that there were gonna be all sorts of parasitic relatives distant or whatever
like jonathan
coming up and saying
did she tell you about jonathan
trying to get him a job
oh yeah well then see that's another thing
she doesn't understand it well
tommy spencer
well why
alin uh cathy don't you understand that you know things are different now you have this mega house and uh you know you have this
you know things are different
but they
they th the they kind of thrive on that they like having people having to owe th that's part of the reason they're not burning their bridges right
so
to where
that is a great line
to where is that hilarious that's typical thompson he is so funny
but um my husband not your professor
um no for this stupid new year's eve party then
tommy spencer who's up there who y was jonathan and loren's best friend right he opens his big mouth to jonathan that cathy and jawahar are having this party so cathy calls me up and she wants jonathan's ph address and go for what she goes well we have to invite him to the new year's eve party
go why she goes well tommy spencer opened his big mouth and said oh so you're going to host them are you she goes what do you mean host them said if you invite them up there for a party they're gonna assume that they are staying with you right she goes no they're not nya and said well that's what they're gonna think and said if you invite them you'll also have to invite liza and antonio you want them staying at the house too so next thing you know they dropped at least that bridge they weren't too unhappy about burning
hm god
but keith and sally those two b drips the one that told me was shoveling my food and didn't need a fork
um they're friends with this other friend of theirs and they're trying to
th th that they don't talk to anymore and mean campbell's a cocaine user abuser dealer that's all he does campbell's a lawyer you know he's just no good so he they're trying to b you know have them be friends again well what what for cathy why are you gonna go they were gonna go to this dinner party
saturday night to see them go what are you gonna do that for who cares
does she have any friends you think
up there
why
cathy she's not a good friend herself
jawahar's a really nice guy
he is a nice guy
he is but he doesn't understand how to mix friends at all we already went through that when first got back from italy and was up there
he we were friends with this one australian guy and he was friends with this other idiot from new zealand dennis and one night he figured oh both part of the same world you know f new zealand australia so he invited doctor spargo out with dennis well didn't get along with dennis at all he was a jerk did not like him period and spargo was okay and we go out and or we went out and these guy they were at each other's throats the whole night long competition galore
really
oh yeah each one was fighting for our affections
that was very apparent knew that was gonna happen plus they didn't like each other spar well spargo was older you know and he was real bright and he knew that this guy was a jerk if we went to parties and there was somebody who came up to try to talk to us he'd keep em away just like a little t um australian sheep dog running around rar rar rar rar rar rar
all this protective stuff going on
it was a lot of fun
whoops i'm sorry knocked me off but cathy and jawahar don't understand how to mix their friends at all they don't understand that it's also okay not to have everybody at the same party
is she working
you can't
or doing anything
she works for jawahar
but
you know
so then um
what does this mean
well she answers phones
wasn't she she said she wanted to go back to school or something do something with her life or she's too into computers
they're boring
you know aren't they boring they're so boring
mean it's like who cares
offense but think that you can get caught up in computers like within what
five weeks or something
you gotta sit there and you you know oh you
you space out on it she's like talking about and and you know
she know she's passionate about it
i'm like
can't relate leave me alone
can't relate at all
just don't care really don't care this party went to friday night where joy was jamming on that harmonica that was absolute well first of all it's paddlers and thought oh it's going to be boring don't wanna go hector wouldn't go he said i'm working late lina you go if you want okay sweets i'll go if want and don't joy like cause she's really interesting but a lot of those other paddlers are idiots did not wanna go so walk in she's changing apartments she's moving into her own condo walk in and the first hint that there's this is gonna be something a little bit unusual is there's all these helium balloons ut up at the ceiling with uh metallic colored streamers coming down three streamers each balloon mean the whole ceiling is just packed with these helium balloons it was so much fun so walk in and see two of the paddlers definitely don't wanna see
one of which had a halloween party told her we're coming we show up she'd already left for another party said why the hell didn't you tell me you were leaving oh well thought you'd you know m didn't think you were coming alina said if say i'm showing up show up we had to go some place for hector's work first you know the wonder years where got insulted by this other little assistant twat who since has been fired thank god but anyway um then you know we showed up there and they were all gone that really irritated me you know what do you mean yes ha i'm having a party come and you show up and there's nobody there
but anyway
um
she's sitting there and this other girl who's always nyah nyah nyah
so have this pair of suede pants that got you've seen them probably ninety million times got those from sak's fifth off they're men's
you know there's nothing great about those pants
they're filthy and there's parts in them you know
where mean they use substandard stuff
so there's you know these goofy little white spots and everything and they're going oh alina you look so chic
in your suede pants and i'm going oh yeah real chic you know my hair's dirty have it pulled back in a pony tail know look lovely so i'm sitting there talking to these idiots for a while
then
this new wave of people comes in
these three guys walk in and one guy was so geeky he's in a suit who the hell do you know goes to a party in a suit mean who is this geek so anyway the other guy had a real nice shirt on and then there was some other geek so the guy with the nice shirt came in and started talking to me and he t his name's like billy mulholland or something and he's um from bakersfield originally and joy's father had hired him to to sell or joy had actually hired him to sell jewelry in hawaii from her father's store but now he's sells vreal estate in malibu and he's got a painting con contracting whatever and one of the things that they're doing is um is painting this building on melrose so it looks like you can see through the wall cause there's you know plastic first and then this stuff behind it or whatever it is but his renditions of homosexuals thought was gonna die and hadn't you know just looked at him he was going on and on about how these guys at his work cause he's down there supervising work and he looks out and these guys and he starts talking about their gstrings are showing through their tight leather pants and he was just going on and on and on and was getting hysterical was laughing so hard and just finally looked at him and said hey never even thought about it because grew up in the swish alps you know
we have been here our whole lives and said never knew anybody who was in the closet because as far as i'm concerned they've always been out of the closet well he couldn't handle this that actually knew gay people he walked away from me
god
so
the next guy that comes up and starts talking to me is the guy in the suit
it turns out he's from georgia atlanta georgia and he's talking away to me and he his name is and said oh like doctor and he goes exactly right he's a thoracic surgeon
or some horse manure
but meanwhile it's just like this right here in my face and kept backing up backing
he's right here in my face
he keeps staring at my chest and it's like
you know fuck you asshole why don't you look at my face
oh shit
but he didn't believe me was married
kept t he's talking about how we should carry on a conversation later
i'm going no no said don't you know really don't think my husband would appreciate that
said you know it's a little difficult having three in the same bedroom
you know at least that's not my shtick but um
he's
he didn't believe me that was married he thought was giving him the brushoff that's cool so they had their other friend come over and meet me who's a lawyer and it's really bizarre cause guessed all of their ages and they were like blown away they were saying well that's what happens when you're this elderly age but um meanwhile in had walked these two really s kind of scruffy looking guys you know not cause these guys were all like you know mister hip and here comes these two other guys one's a black guy and one's this uh white guy with this beard
uhoh
he's got like a lorimar sweatshirt on so i'm sitting there and the
lorimar
kept trying to talk to me
talk to me you know
doctor he is a doctor yeah but that's all he'd give his name for
oh
but
god
he's had an interesting command of the english language because all double entendres you know but if you didn't understand your english you didn't understand what he was saying
so he was actually a lot of fun to stalk to
had a good time with him that's actually even b how we even started talking and he started talking to one of the other paddlers who's k probably going through a divorce this year and he used the same lines on her and she didn't get it
oh well
so you know
he was like really bored and left but anyway
started talking to the black guy when walked off and you know all of a sudden you're realizing this guy is stringing sentences complicated sentences together and y he knows what you're talking about and he's dropping literary terms and names and you're kind of going
where are you from he's a he's a army brat and has he speaks fluent german he's lived in about thirty places and said god you know that must have really made you d you know it's you must have a good time at making new friends it's easy for you and he said oh yeah he had that but also what it'd done is it caused him to be introverted so he read a lot when he was a kid so he's really self taught and you know kind of one of the things he did was he kind of took up the guitar at twelve now he's thirtyfive you ought to hear that guy on the guitar he's absolutely amazing the guy with the beard was his good buddy they both work for the phone company the guy with the beard must be about six four six five and uh he got his first degree in fire science his parents were his mother was fortyeight when he was born his father was fiftyone they died when he was thirteen he put himsel he k graduated from high school early went through fire science major at forgot the people from the west side do that a lot they go through this stupid fire science major out at become firemen and now he you know and now he works for the phone company and he's he's uh putting himself he's going to be a microwave engineer
he's going to because that's the only place you can go at night
wow
brilliant he's been in there since nineteen eighty
hunh
i'm sitting there you know he's like thirtyfive now
talking to him he had a big old hicky here he told me he was going to another party said oh you want a matching set
oh god
the black guy laughed he goes
oh you noticed
said yeah turtlenecks don't hide everything but the black guy's father works with the um
oh you're kidding
so no
he set up so the black guy set up all the phones during the olympics
he was the best like guy out there at the olympics or you know he had g special coverage and special protection and everything
wow
but they were so much fun to talk to had a ball ended up you know and all the paddlers were going yeah alina talking to all the boys don't they know you're married are you they said like told just cause i'm married ain't dead
still like to go to parties i'm sorry
shit
and he goes
so you're married and said yeah i'm married and said so is he he's married too
he goes oh well that makes it convenient then uh always like it when both of you are married to each other
said so do
hector
oh god
poor little hector he's been having a hell of a time pulling his hair out he's been grumpy for three months
well it's over now
isn't it
he was actually talkative tonight when called him on the phone he talked to me for like fifteen minutes tonight do you know how long it's been since he's been able to k talk to me on the phone
who does he work with now
kevin
rosenblum
ke no uh well yeah
rosenblum's down the hall and then it's kevin's his assistant
then they don't have the third editor but it's so nice
him and kevin
essentially
yeah kevin's his assistant but they're trying to get kevin to kevin's been in production before he's has actually been associate producer before
they want kevin to take hector's place
that's a possibility but jake will block it otherwise known as nixon
who's gonna take hector's
who's gonna
nix nix it nixon
nixon
so
uh who's gonna take hector's place
it don't know they'll have to see
they gonna bring in some neurotic from new jersey
sounds like a good idea
somebody that could sit there and take orders and listen to what they have to say and how they wanna do it part of the problem with this whole thing was that uh how see it was that ellen was not relinquishing t her duties to let hector go ahead and run it jake was feeling threatened sc because associate producer is supposed to run editorial and b it makes sense hector had an emmy nomination would let him run editorial would let him do anything he wanted to do in editorial they clipped his wings they wouldn't let him do anything there are three shows in trouble he was not allowed to help on any of em none of em
that's changed now though he can be like he was before again
edit and the neurotics are out
well what's gonna happen that he is editorial period cause st stevie's supposed to leave in february so unless they f they they have to look for an editor
rosenblum's coming back though isn't he
don't know what he's gonna do he wants to work actually features he doesn't really wanna do
hm
went and saw their house the other night
where is it
their new house
it's um you know where beverly glen is
it's one of those streets off of there
it's a nice little
rth or south of sunset
oh south of course way down
oh
they're right off of pico and know how crass true cuz but it's in right next door is ted rich who's uh one of the biggies at or lorimar or oh forgot which one
one of them
one of those places it all means the same to me
you know
really
can never tell the difference
lorimar
except one day
hector was s you know they were scoring the show last week and and called up to talk to him
could hear the um the musicians in the background tuning up their instruments
then you know and it's okay to talk to hector could hear him a little bit but not too well but you know still could talk to him and the next thing you hear all these horns blaring so he said lina have to go no shit
can't hear you at all
sweetheart call me when can hear you it was funny that's the only part i'll miss
so
but
his position is pretty uh
stable yeah fletcher well see actually fletcher was going to ask hector to move back to editorial but he didn't know how to approach him cause he thought he was so thrilled about being associate producer but hector really hated it so hector's the one when was it two weekend two weekends ago or last weekend he c he said he looked at me and he goes pso lina what happens on hanukkah and was going can't exactly remember the story but all know is you light a candle and open a present and he goes so if call fletcher it wouldn't be any great shakes and said nope
said what h he di never told me why he was calling up fletcher so um sunday he looked at me and he goes i'm calling fletcher want to go back to editorial said okay go ahead so he called fletcher and fletcher was so relieved cause he wanted to ask hector to move back to editorial he's just happy he did it
why did he want to ask hector to move back to editorial
because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff that they couldn't get what they wanted out of sherry
they couldn't get what it they wanted out of seppie it's actually not seppie's fault it's kind of they needed to work with him more but that sherry was impossible she was a witch and then her assistant pulled stunts where she didn't do stuff that everybody knows assistants do which wouldn't know but cause i'm no assistant but things like making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects so that they can follow along and make certain that their sound effects are going in the right spots that kind of thing she totally screwed up the the show that they're working on now don't know what number that is sylvia
what show is being shown now
well it's the one they're working on v the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown
but what one is tonight
tonight don't know
four five
six
this i don't know we'll have to ch oh this is the second one in the new season
hm
but don't know if this was really number two
hm
how they placed it or if it was like like you said number three four or five because they had such a b hard time with it like last week's wasn't supposed to be shown even though it was supposed to be number one because it was so poorly done it had so much wrong with it hector kept trying to get it corrected like a month ago and they kept stopping him stopping stopping stopping stopping
cause of her
cause of her cause of jake nixon he didn't want him to do it and it makes him look like an idiot cause he's the director and you can tell where he's missed the shots has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else it's jake but he'll s he'd cut off his nose to spite his face that's stupid so now fletcher's starting to realize what's going on it's hard because the hatchet man actually in the group is ed ed's the one that'll come in and he'll go ahead and say this is what needs to be done okay and h or he'll look at you and he'll go that was a stupid thing to do why'd you do that you know makes the editor really stop and think or makes whoever it is stop and think the director but fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go well mhm well let me see that that seemed to be okay but i'll have to think about it he's real wishywashy he's too uh namby pamby you need somebody to come in and go
tso they're kind of suffering that from that this year not having that on there but fletcher's having to learn how to be more assertive otherwise his show's just gonna go down the tubes
they can't afford that right now
how many countries is it in do you know
mm all know is cathy saw it in france
oh really
forgot what it's called something
huh
it's about has to do with the bar generation um
the bar genera
generation yeah uh
what
what is it
the bar generation in what sense bar generation
oh no pub the pub the pub generation
there you go
pub
french
so cathy they watched it in french
g
it was absolutely hilarious
oh god
know cuz know thought that was really funny
dorks
the pub generation
wow have it in france
know
that's good
they they saw mako
did tell you harlan's wife
where
they had dinner with her one night
yeah
cathy said oh yeah supposedly alina's been on this diet and lost weight
god said wasn't gonna do this anymore stay up late kinda defeats the purpose of getting up in the morning
know and it's a hard habit to break usually don't
it is
s usually don't stay up late but it's like if i'm up after midnight it's just like
hm yeah yeah
what can do now
still can't
god still can't believe tim bitching around and he lied too he said that he talked to ron and all this other shit
about what
about the way they were feeling of them being the only ones cleaning the house and all this other shit mean what they don't realize is like shit when ron gets home from work wanna spend time with ron because ron usually doesn't get home till nine or ten
unlike tim he has to work for every little dime that he makes you know
he doesn't get any breaks
tim is on salary and he can take leave and
mhm and he earns leave
he's
he gets sick leave we don't get shit
don't know it is really hard living with another couple
mean we if we set our if we sit down and set some rules which we never did it could work you know
mhm
what it amounts to is mutual r respect and l like tim told ron he told him he goes um what was it he goes nobody fucks with my lifestyle feel the exact same way and all those bitches and complaints that he has they're about my lifestyle
mhm
he doesn't realize that
that's what i'm gonna tell him
well you know
the only way it's gonna work is if we have respect for one another
that's right that's right
it doesn't mean going to our parents and complaining about one another i'm gonna tell him if you have any complaints you talk to the person that you have the complaint about i'm also going to suggest weekly house meetings to discuss such things
mhm oh yeah yeah you know what it would be a real good lesson for them too in self assertiveness
you know and especially the way um mean tim gets in himself into a uncomfortable situation or whatever and his first reaction is to blow up about it
mhm
you know cause he let he lets it pile
he doesn't do nothing positive about it and then he just blows
if something bothers you you go and you was like last year was really proud of myself when was asked to take over intermediate algebra
unhunh
teach it
did
also went
asked for a raise instead of
cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour was now gonna be up there teaching it
mhm
instead of getting the five dollars an hour ended up getting fifteen
really
but went and asked now if i you know if you put a situation like that to tim or mandy cause not because they're they're weak in character or anything but because they're
they're babies
they hem and haw around and somebody else would have to talk for them you know
don't know and it's right now uh don't know if should mention it to him or what but i'm feeling like he's taking me for granted
and he's rolling in it mary and you know what the sad thing the thing that really scares me is that they're n th at the rate they're going and with all the breaks that they've gotten they're never gonna have hard times
hard times do train you
they do
like came over here to work with danae which is what i'm going to do i'm going to do some translations for her and stuff
tonight and um
you know have to make at least fifty dollars or so
to make it worth my time but like tonight well called you know this thing was going on with buck and everything so called um mandy's or called our house and mandy answered the phone and said where's you know where's where is ron there and she said no when we were on our way to tim's game he was at town pump and he asked what time we'd be home and we said probably about nine and she said then we went over to your grandma's but then we came back and he wasn't here yet so called the town pump and asked if he was still in the casino course he wasn't he was on his way home and said tell so called mandy back and told her to have him call me when he got home so was in the bathtub when he called and talked to him for a while and he went and he was really down about what what told him that tim had said to me and how was so upset he goes why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up said did and he wouldn't do it
really
mhm he goes they w they were sitting around getting all fucked up he said but he said went right to bed he said didn't get done working until after nine
oh man
cause that fivecar pile up they had between hardin and crow
oh shit really didn't hear about it
ron was singlehandedly there with one wrecker
seems like any time i've seen a wrecker out here there's always two guys in there
hmm everyone was gone when the call came in
oh
jay's not supposed to go on those anymore because of his heart so he had to send ron by himself and ron was slowly pulling everybody out of the ditch
did they all hit each other or just
kind of a semi bumped a car and then went and went on two wheels and just about lost it and then got back up on all all its wheels again
oh did it land in the ditch
but it kind of it was able to get out but all the other cars that were in the direct vicinity all hit the ditch and then there was three cars and the semi and then this uh this guy pulled up and
he was going to uh peggy
you remember peggy white
her husband gary bighare
mhm
him and her pulled up and they were in the van and they stopped to ask ron what happened and here another car came and rearended em
oh
they ended up having to take um peggy white by helicopter to billings
man that's pretty bad
know darn this darn dog keeps breathing and like dreaming you know wonder if we should wake her
she'll get scared and want to go outside kinda nervous you know
they say you can really mess up a dog by waking em up when they're dreaming
really
mhm it's so cold outside but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there
know you know what was thinking of doing
hunh
don't know she's kind of shy but was wondering
what it would be like to train her
to pull a sled
don't know if she'd do it
don't know if she would either she's kind of timid
mhm she doesn't trust too many people at all
oh and you know another thing that tim had the audacity to bitch about
what
he said um mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree until four in the morning and even asked if we could put our ornaments on there and they told me that there wouldn't be enough room
really
mhm tim said that
she was probably lonely when she was doing it you know that she probably was
sat up with her and was talking to her she was doing all the decorating mean what was gonna do she mean she was just putting up the balls and everything and she'd say where where do you think this should go and so was sitting there doing my welfare application and uh you know was just sitting there watching her telling her where to put everything and what not
did you know nickie wanted her own tree
forgot to bring it in it's outside
what are you gonna do with it
she wants to set it up for her barbies was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom
mhm
just stick it in there and you know what did
hm
didn't want to waste a tree's life
so just cut a branch off one god fell up there
where'd you go to get em
you know where sarah and arvela live
mhm
just around the corner remember that first cattle guard you go over
unhunh
didn't even go over that
you mean kinda like by the by the tunnel
right below the tunnel
oh
just walked up we just walked up around uh that area god alice that was fun
did you get grandma a tree too
hunhunh
does she already have one
hmm that pickup could only hold like three
mm wonder why did daddy say to take the pickup back or what was the deal
yeah
why
cause phoebe needs it
what's wrong with the car
oh you didn't hear about it
hunhunh
oh you did about how the engine was on fire
mhm
see there was oil spilling out leaking out from the valve cover
mhm
the valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever and there was oil coming out and the oil got hot and you know how it gets hot and smokes
mhm
well guess enough came out because we were losing oil bad going from billings to crow um there's a lot of
smoke coming out and by the time we got to hardin we had to put like uh three or four quarts in
unhunh
it was three and by the time we got to
crow it was it was one quart low and there was smoke still coming from under the engine figure w if it was losing that much oil then it caught fire
mhm
cause the engine was hot cause there wasn't enough water in the radiator
mhm
talked to oscar about it and he said well checked it was only it was only about i'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water but that shouldn't make any difference he goes the only thing can think of is that there was an air lock in there
that running the engine out on the open road
mhm
caused that air lock to come through flushed it out
bust the gasket
it would more or less um the engine wasn't being kept cool enough cause there wasn't enough fluid in the radiator
unhunh
you know how the radiator's the pipe's close to other parts of the engine
so what
it was some part in there
caused the fire
the engine being too hot and the oil leaking
so he knew that the oil was leaking
we knew we were losing oil but we didn't know where just figured it was from that valve cover gasket just from lifting up the hood and looking at it
so what's he gonna do
well and two of his wires the sparkplug wires
unhunh
were fried all the way through
unhunh
so we took those off and we replaced them with some old ones out of the garage
knew that
it runs it runs there's enough uh radiator fluid in there
mhm
so that it will it's it's enough
mhm
but think running it out on the open road will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out
mhm
that valve cover gasket has to be replaced
hm
don't know oh freaked cookie and rita and gary out tonight remember the plain plainfeather uh claypit where that red clay is
mhm
right there saw my my speedometer just go brr like that just down you know and knew exactly what it was what have to do is take off the distributor wire and splice it in with the fuel pump wire
mhm
because my fuel pump is now electric never used to be
mhm
hand me that ashtray or your light mean your light it's behind the sewing machine
uh sometimes it gets loose
no more fuel
unhunh
so stopped the car and they said what are you doing said oh gotta tighten this wire here so had cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off so cause see once you turn that key on then you hear the the fuel pump come on
mhm
if the wire's not connected right it doesn't come on
mhm
so did that and lit a match to find out where was and n after everything was hunkydory then shut the hood and got back in and started up the engine and both gary and rita were sitting on the edges of their seat and turned around and looked and said did scare you kids they wouldn't say anything then gary goes yeah was scared
but freaked em out don't know then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing matchstrikework
mhm
said long as don't drive it fast it should be alright but oh man don't know see the thing about it is if go after ken i'm not really gonna have any money
mhm
to um you know do things i'm not saying i'm gonna pay for everything but don't want to be broke around him
know that really sucks
cause wanna at least be able to put gas in the car
mhm
go do something
don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter
mm i've been thinking about that
we should all get some money together and is there any way he could like
meet us in great falls or something cause i'd like to go up there and go to the um red lobster
really
cause i've been just craving seafood
that's the halfway point he could do it
bet he could do it when though
don't know
he goes back to school like the second
oh shoot well isn't there any way like we that we could just meet him up there and maybe
what bring him down
bring him down or don't wanna take your car
was gonna ask you and mom too if you could um take care of trace for a couple days next week
oh what you got in mind
need to get caught up on my work
wednesday have an appointment at nine thirty
mom's off isn't she
oh that's right that's right
think that'd think that'd um work out like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her and help her with him
mhm
remember was pregnant with nicky and uh boots's little boy he really liked me
mhm
when was pregnant with her
mhm
you know how it is when we're pregnant we get real sleepy
mhm
i'd fall asleep on the couch and he'd lay by me
mhm
he'd fall asleep with me and remember he would woke up and here he was gone his mother carried him in the other room
mhm
god that kind of pissed me off
was would um was nicky mad when trace was a boy
kind of she thinks should have twins twin girls
but don't think she'll realize the uh sibling rivalry
but don't know she's six years old now and they say that if there's six years between children there's not that much rivalry
after four there's almost none
really
mhm
cause they're
four is ideal
they're kind of in different worlds
because see trace will be the next time have a baby trace will probably be about three four
hm
that's when i'm gonna get this shit taken out
tammy kashen has one of these too
what is it
rplant
oh really
deon told me cause asked him what his intentions were with her cause told him thought he was too young to be so involved
gwen was telling me that did she talk to you lately
hmm
they had a cyst on her ovary and they had to go in and take it out
mhm
take out that cyst
mhm
it's really screwed up her uh
menstrual p cycle
her cycle her her hormones
unhunh
they said that she might have to get pregnant again just to straighten it out
so and then she goes so tell tell deon and she really laughed
don't know if tammy would be too happy with that though seems to me that she's trying to straighten herself out and pursue a family
tammy
what do you think
don't know
or do you think it might be a matter of convenience
think it's a convenience for both of em
yeah
it's also a convenience for cookie
ay um
the the way that your testimony is coming in don't know if explained this to you on the phone
hmm
is when a person is charged with multiple crimes and um there are other incidences where he acted in the same way
mhm
when we have to prove in this case we have to prove specific intent
to expose himself to a person for sexual arousal
mm
um when we have to prove something like specific intent um or we have to prove identity because he's disputing identity in a coup in at least one of the cases
hm
um then we are allowed to bring in prior similar conduct um where he acted in a an identical way or where the victims were in a similar situation
ay
things like that that's why we're able to have you come in and testify
ay
ay um the cases that we have already are um one happened back in october of nineteen ninety
alright
it happened on and it's almost a carbon copy of your case
well i've made two one a year from almost a year from the uh police report
saw that in your report haven't seen the other report
made that one through matter of fact it was just over the phone and they never called me back or anything and a year later it happened again
ay
then that's when they made the report and said they were gonna do something about it
ay
so it happened around
so you can testify to two of em
that's why had you come up because
um that's great
um mean not for you
but
mhm
for us
um i in our first case amelia gonzalez um that uh that happened back in ninety and she was seated a in the rear of the train
which you were
mhm
um nobody else was around and he sort of walked up and down the train
down the aisle mhm
checked everything out
then sat down
mhm
put the newspaper on his lap
masturbated and then lifted the paper
for her to see and she saw it in the the reflection
n n oh the mirror
cause she was looking out the window
that's how did it too
saying don't want to see this
cause didn't want to see him so looked this way and you can see it
right
you know
cause it turns into the mirror effect
mhm
he was just sort of staring at her and lifting up the paper
mhm
um so anyway
exactly
it c it's a carbon copy
um in that case he's he sits through all the testimony and he just sort of shakes his head and makes these big gasps like you know we're creating this whole thing against him
hm
um
then with june
um the woman that just walked out
unhunh
um she was riding on and he came and sat near her she moved he moved to get closer to her she moved again and he moved directly opposite her
mhm
then started masturbating
so
well see what it is it seems like he wants someone more scary y don't know cause he would walk up and down the aisles there was women on the other side too but they'd look like you know you wouldn't mess with em but if you're sitting there you know trying to mind your own business or
right
look like you can intimidate someone you know
right
i
that's what it look like
think that's think he he finds somebody that's isolated
mhm
he goes for a certain age group think
um and you know like for some reason think he likes students or people who look like students
unhunh mhm
so anyway okay um did you as far as your um mileage goes what would did
oh how much was it
hundred and thirty s don't know
ay
we got the um that ticket for our
parking
ay
they moved the gate or something the how to get in the parking lot cause it used to be on
oh yeah
because they built this building
oh see
that's where the yeah
we had to get back all the way on the freeway
oh no
was like oh god there was a door here before a entrance you know
couldn't find it
but uh we found it
um oh okay do you know how much it's gonna be
oh no not yet
ay um do you guys have the cash to pay for it right now when you to get out
think so
ay then what i'll do is when you can i'll call you and find out
ay
what have to do is submit all of this to our accounting department
ay
they give you the they'll mail you the reimbursement
ay
so you guys hang on to that
ay
so you can get out
ay
alright
then imagine it will be about five dollars or so
ay
um so a hundred and thirty about a hundred and thirty five you think
mhm
ay so round trip it'll be like two seventy
two si yeah
that's from salinas
mhm
do you go by rickie reeding reeding rollins or do you just go by rickie rollins
uh r um well my name is regina just go by rickie
ay
uh don't know if you have to put my regina in there
probab
um i regina rollins is fine it doesn't matter
ay okay

unhunh
ay so um
it's hard to describe how so yeah was sitting backwards in the back seat
ay
the very end seat
when he came in when where was he when you first saw him come in
he got on the train on like think twelfth street or something in oakland and like in a let me see okay he got on another car but you can seen him because seen him a year ago
unhunh
so seen him when the you know how the train goes and you can see everybody out the window well he got in another door
ay
he came through here
ay alright so he came through here
mhm
when he came through here did he look at you at all
mhm
initially
what did he do
just looked he had a
did he stop walking
n just kinda looked and then looked and then walked
ay
then he kept walking yeah
when he looked at you the first time was he sort of looking you up and down or did he just look at your seat what
just like you know look uh guess
at you
at me di
ay
and look at my seat cause always sit all the way to the window
ay
so thought he was gonna sit down actually
ay
hunh
then he continued on
unhunh
where did he go
he went all the way to the you know into the train
all the way up here
mhm
ay
then uh he went through the door and then he came back again
ay
he went through there
he went through these doors
into it unhunh into another car
oh
then he came back again and then guess that was like another stop and more people were getting off and then that's when he came and sat by me sat in this seat right here but there was someone sitting there too there was a lady
you're kidding
unhunh there was a lady sitting there but she got up and she went to another seat
ah
she she just went to a different seat
ay
you know like but he was making don't know how you describe it you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone
mhm
or you may smell or something
you know like that you know
or moving around you know like as he wanted her to move
ay
she got up and moved
she okay um and so when she moved was there anybody seated
in this area
think maybe like you know how these chairs are
unhunh
maybe right here and you know
ay
but you couldn't they couldn't see nothing or anybody
ay but nobody right

in these areas
don't believe so
ay alright so then what did he do
um did the newspaper you know looking at it you know making loud noises guess so think like that or whatever then he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that and then he went in and then he just you can just see him going like this you know how you have to unzip your pants
or something like that and i'm looking through the window and then he's still making noises with the paper and then um kinda looked and then didn't and kept making like s uh you know like you know like know what you're
he was making noises like that
no he was making those you know the rattling paper
unhunh
but was making noises like tskhx you know like wanted him to know know what you're doing
you know remembered him for a year from a year ago and so then just kept you know just turned you know away from him and looked in the window and he just kept hitting the paper like that you know but you know what he was doing
he kept hitting the paper and um uh let me see then one time just you know kinda looked over and then you can see it you know you can see it
had he lifted up the paper in any way or
just like you know i'm trying to see how a paper goes likes thi
like this
ay like he has the paper like like this just like you know moves it like that you know like that
oh
you know and you can see it
ay
you know
was he looking at you at all during that time
the whole entire time
ay
mean not looking at first he would go like this even with the paper and look at me you know trying to get my attention
like he wanted me to look at him and then the whole time under here he'd just look mean he looked so hard that it was like burning you know what mean
it
tell the jury that
ay
that's mean that's great
he just alright
um because that's what he does
ay
that's his way of drawing your attention to him
mhm
because if somebody's doing that to you there's no way you're gonna you know just totally ignore them
cause you're always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision
at least
mhm
to make sure where they are
mhm yeah cause was you know didn't know what he was gonna do
or anything so
so um part of our burden is to prove that he's deliberately doing th that he has the specific intent to draw your attention to him
ay
so let them know that he was doing that
ay alright
um okay so then and then he sort of pulled the paper aside and he's still staring at you
unhunh still staring and just you know and then but when uh uh like you come to a stop see that's all through the tunnel you know that's a long like about
mhm
five minute ride or something couple of minutes ride and we got to like embarcadero he would just you know go like this you know before anyone got on and wait and then just do the same thing until had to get off at my stop
tell the jury about that too because that indicates that he knew what he was doing was wrong
hm oh okay
if there was a chance that any man might walk by
y mhm
you know had another case or have a pr report from another case where um he wa he was crouched down and doing it
mhm
then when a man would walk by he'd sit
you know do nothing and then once the man was through the doors then he'd go back doing it
okay
so um okay so then you got off
at your stop
um and how were you feeling
well it was like s don't know sorry
you doing alright
just don't know like disgusted you know wh why really wanted to report it this time because it was like summertime
unhunh
the kids you know the kids and everything
that's what was scared of because know how uh was you know a victim of you know abuse like that or just you know just that's what was think the very first time reported it was just like this dirty old man just that that
this time it was during the summer and there was lots of kids and um just felt like you know upset you know
just you know just felt upset
ay
you know n
tell the jury that um it's it's really important that they understand
the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you
cause
my one concern about this case is um that some people may have the attitude of
well he never touched you
mhm
he didn't make any verbal threats to you it's no big deal
especially have some young single men on my jury panel
mhm
my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels when something like that is happening
mhm
because their experience would be totally different if a man exposes himself
which a man would never do that
mhm
because
number one they pick out think more vulnerable people
mhm
but if um a man were to be exposed to they would laugh or you know be disgusted
mhm
or be mad but they wouldn't necessarily feel
scared or threatened
unhunh
hi
hi
can sit with you
um so r relate that information to the jury
ay
ay um and then uh so then when you got off you called the police
right
went upstairs to the and told them and tried to tell them what train it was and just was still kind of like shocked so was like well have to go cause have to make an appointment but did tell someone said i'll be back to make a report or whatever had to do and then there was a different person down there and when called the police they said oh no one's even said anything to us you know and uh
that was that and then think uh couple of days after one of the uh detectives called me and then made a report he wanted to see if can him first and then we just made a report and he said he'll submit it and everything
ay and you id'ed him immediately
unhunh he just showed me he's all okay come with me come with me you know
ay alright have a and this is i if they make an issue out of it this is what you looked at right
mhm
like a folder with different
yeah right there
have the one where you signed right underneath it
unhunh yeah
we've got the statement where you immediately said i'm hundred percent sure this is the guy
mhm yeah
so okay
what is he a old man
he's like sixties
in his yeah
godx
he's like balding like
you can come in the courtroom
oh good
ay
um she has anxiety attacks when she gets excited and
see that's why i'm s
she gets real nervous and scared
that's why am tra
unhunh
she has bad anxiety attacks
can't breathe
she she'll ju
oh really
that's why i'm trying to
sh that's why she's crying
ay
so
ay um m how
do have to look at anyone just you or
you can just look at me
ay
um when you go in let me explain to you what the courtroom's like so you know what to expect
ay
um you you don't have to you know and if you if you feel like you need to take a break
mhm
then tell me immediately
ay
um or ask the judge you'll be seated right near the judge
ay
um was saying to june that you know a lot of times people are intimidated by the courtroom and they think it's really formal and it's really not that formal
mhm okay
um the jurors that are in there there'll be twelve people seated in the juror box
mhm
um
you know they could be your family they could be your friends
mhm
um they're all y y from all walks of life
mhm
um they're all different ages and um they you know for the most part they were probably very nervous when they came in just for jury duty
so
um
they just want to hear your story and they're not judging you
ay
um let me show you
baby
hm hmm mhm
will it help to have him in there
unhunh
good
she was going crazy all day here think that's him every time every time she seen a
the whole time down here
was like that ain't him
was doing that that's him that's him like that he was like oh no no it's not him just come on
don't know where drew it out
so is he in like jail or something or he just shows up for court
he's out right now
oh okay
he will be
oh okay
at the end of this if the jury does the right thing
alright
um we asked for ninety days county jail before the case went to trial
mhm
normally um it'll be higher if he's convicted
ay
so plus he's got your case pending in oakland
oakland
if there's a if we get a conviction just on one case here
mhm
then your case in oakland will be a felony
oh okay
so
alright
um okay yu what will happen is you'll walk into the courtroom here
mhm
there are doors right here
there are seats right here um that are for the audience but normally there's nobody in the audience but
ay
your husband will be there um and then there are two tables right here i'll be seated at this table
mhm
the defendant and the defense attorney will be seated at this table
mhm
the jury sits here okay all in a row um
then and you'll walk thr when you walk in you'll walk through and i'll walk with you
ay
um to the ch the witness chair okay
ay
which faces out this way
alright
the judge is seated right here
alright
right above you and then there's a woman who sits here who's the clerk and there's a woman who sits here the who's the court reporter
ay
so when ask you questions
when you're talking you need to uh always say yes or no as opposed to unhunh or unhunh
oh okay
or nodding your head okay because she takes everything down
ay
um
if your nervous please tell me
ay
or tell the judge and we can take a break
ay
if you want to get a drink of water or something like that
ay
ay um and take your time you know when you walk in just take a deep breath
ay
take your time if ask you a question that you don't understand tell me
ay
um if we either of us ask you a question where
um it's something you don't remember it's a detail that you don't remember
mhm
it's fine to say don't don't remember at this time
ay
ay um
is there gonna b the other person his lawyer gonna ask some questions
hyeah
cross examine
he'll be able to ask you questions also he's he's a very polite guy
ay
he's a young attorney um he's with the public defender's office he's um w when we had the case the last time it was a different attorney
mhm
that attorney terrorized my my one victim that put on um he walked up to her and he was about this far away from her
mhm
sh cause she had testified when he walked in initially and he looked at me walter munson she said knew he was a pervert just by the way he looked at me
oh
so this man walked up to him and he said i'm standing close to you i'm looking at you does that make me a pervert
mhm
uh just badgered her
aw
but this this attorney is not like that at all
okay
he'll be very polite um
mhm
he's going to try and focus more on uh discrepancies like if you testify to one thing and there's something written differently in the report
unhunh
he might say well you know in your
in the report it says that you um you know he sat down right across from you
mhm
immediately
oh okay
as opposed to walking or something like that
ay
which it doesn't but
ay
um he's gonna try and focus on little things cause that's all he can do
ay
but
for the most part he'll be polite and gentle
ay
so you don't have to worry about him
hm
um what hap well tell me about the year ago incident
um that one was at night time and um was working late and it was around remember used to get off ar around nine and used to get to um the bart station around ten o'clock and he would be think i'm trying to think would he get on or would he already be on well that's the daly city one so he would get on when would get on but think probably like a different car and same thing exact identical go up and down the aisles but
would be the only one in the train you know because at night time there's not many people on there and he would do that and was was terrified then because was the only one there was no one around
you know was a little scared this time but you know but there's people around like you know don't think he would do anything when people are around
right
you know down at the other seats or in back
right
could scream but
at night time he was doing the same thing and called that night to the bart police and told them what he looked like and everything and never heard anything again so
ay um
did he use a newspaper that time also
mhm
so identical
everything yeah
ay
then even told them said and the funny thing is he just the only thing he changed this time is um he wore a new bow tie and uh a different bag hx cause he always had a bag cause the what made the interested in this case they s told me well everyone's telling me he has this bag he carries around and he has a bowtie like that and go
that's the only difference he had a different bag this time a year later and a different bow tie
they were like okay you know
w the bag that he was carrying around this time what was it
let me see think a duffel bag think
ay
ay
one time it was a duffel bag and then one time it was like a uh what do you call them
like a sh like a old be
shopping bag
a shopping bag
a plastic
mhm
that's his common one plastic bag filled with papers
ay yeah
in this one you say he's carrying a sho a duffel bag
duffel bag okay
ay so you wanna have you read through your statement recently
do you wanna read through it
ay
ay
hm
w you can't do anything to this guy
oh i'm not i'm just gonna sit back and look
mhm
i'm a little worried about her cause she has them anxiety attacks
she just don't have no control over her body
train
when will the verdict be
um well it depends uh you two are my last witnesses and then the defendant will testify
then we could do closing arguments today or it could be tomorrow and then w we should have a verdict by friday afternoon
ay
later than friday afternoon so i'll call all of you and tell you
is he gonna take the stand
he says so mhm
what could he possibly say
he testified in a trial um about five years ago sa identical situation
really
he said his testimony was my momma didn't raise me to do things like this he totally denied it
mhm
so
so cause was just telling him the same thing happened to my mom
oh really
she was
was it him
don't know she just told me that you know it was a long time ago you're saying five years ago
it was around that time and she told me but he used to don't know she she didn't say anything newspaper whatever but he would do finish the job
oh
everything you know and
oh
so but she said she reported it and no one ever did anything
they're hard cases um to act on
mhm
think the reason why they finally started acting on these and getting the identification
mhm
was because so many of em were coming in
oh okay
do you have any questions june
ay um
i'm going to put june on first
ay
then then rickie
then will you let us know what the final verdict is
hm
definitely hopefully it's good news if it's not i'll be bummed
am doing that right so far
mhm
all the way down to that
mhm think
don't think am do you
you'd have to have that plus or minus
what
don't know what did to get that where did get that square root of um ex squared
because you brought this over here you brought three over here divided by three and then you have ex squared so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex squared
guess all can't figure out is what the square root of negative two thir thi two thirds is would that be
i square root two
i square root two thirds
o over three the whole thing would be over three well no it couldn't be square root of two thirds yeah
but then you got the other one nathan
oh gosh hm leah she snoozing on the floor
mhm not anymore you woke her
she's doing the karate kid nathan
she's like leave me alone do deserve this
mean how would you like it when you're laying in bed
somebody just grabbed your arm started swinging it around
i'd probably just slap em
ex squared equals one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equals the square root of one
she's not even looking at me she's just looking like
know that's what i'm talking about
so would that one be square root of one half
mhm
it would
mhm yep but do y'all have to do that um you have to like have it where you do that there's no um
fraction under the
under the in the denominator mean no fraction under the
oh yeah
so then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two
even for the top one even for that one
for i'm talking about for this one
oh all you do is like go t two over one
you have the square root of one
like that right
mm since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that a square you have to multiply by the square root of two and then you get two and you multiply the top by the square root of two and you get square root of two
what wanna rewind it and hear that back again
cause sure didn't catch it the first time you got the two and you take the square root of two
you get the negative two
which you take the square
it comes to two
i'm sorry
so let's talk about this slowly as write this down as you're saying it alright this is what we came out with right
it's but put it as the square root of one over the square root of two
oh and then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of two
right
uh is that what all those square root of twos are
that's what was try
that's what was trying to say
ay was wondering where all that square root two square root two
that's what it was
then right here you'd get square root of two over two
mhm
see everything was square root two over two and two
right but then what about this one
on this one let me do this one
but you have i you have i square root of three over square root of three mean z i square root of two over three square root of three can't even say it right
over do have another i down here or just the one i
um no just one
ay three and square root of three over square root of three and you get
i square root of six
over three
is that right
doubt it really do
i'm not kidding
you can't you can't multiply square roots like that can you square root of two times square root of three is square root of six is it
ay well then that's fine then that is right
isn't that c you can do that
cause that's the same way you're multiplying there square root of nine that and square root of nine equals three
okay where's the test
there ain't no telling
you have it mean have it okay the next one is five ex times ex minus one
is that it
um
equals two times one minus ex
leah
two times one minus ex
and that's easy you can do that
oh this is easy ex squared please say this will factor will it
na you do it
well mean that's just wasting time cause if it's not yeah
it does
mhm
one and negative twofifths
mhm
can always put those back up into the top
and see if they check right let me just try the one five got zero equals zero
tha that's right
that's one

zero equals zero equals one
ay
fingerprint file you got me down
come on
ex times
hang on number eight ex times
two minus ex
two minus ex
is less than or equal to
don't like these
three times ex minus four
three times ex minus four
right
alright distribute first right
mhm
two ex minus ex squared three ex minus twelve you get do that side so you get ex whoa don't want to do that negative ex squared two ex minus two minus ex um plus twelve now do you factor this after you do that
oh but first gotta take out that negative one don't mean that negative
mhm
in front of that ex squared so just can multiply that whole side by negative one again though
then you flip that sign over
have to flip that sign over if do that
mhm
see it's little rules like that that i'm not gonna remember so if it's a if it's less than or equal to then and there's a minus you have to flip the sign okay are you tired
t really mean kind of but
i'm gonna go home in just a few minutes
why
cause can work on this at home and let you get some sleep
ouch okay so you say ex plus four is greater than or equal to zero so you say ex is greater than or equal to negative four and ex three
or
oh is that one of the ones where you have to do or
if it's less than do you still do or
that's if it's um in the in the b in between those two numbers you know if there's like a like this one don't look but if there's like a ex in the middle
well no that's a or if you have like one number on one side
mm
it says
greater than or equal to ex
like
than l that one's less than or equal to
like two is less than or equal to ex
is less than or equal to
which is less than or equal to
less tha less than or equal to
six
right
so the final ans so that's the answer right
mhm
number nine
ay don't know this one so
you don't know how to do this one so we in trouble
well you apparently knew how to do it
did get it right
well you didn't get the whole thing right
but you well you just missed one part of it
so what's that problem
um absolute value
ay
of onehalf minus ex over three
ex over three oops okay
is less mean is greater than or equal to twothirds
just plain old twothirds
mhm
how do you get rid of the absolute value things don't you
don't you put is less than or equal to twothirds or is greater than mean is greater than or equal to twothirds and then don't you have like i or is less than and is less than or equal to negative two thirds
what can see what did
but when you when you have absolute value when you take the absolute value off and you put negative twothirds on this side too
first i'll just get a common denominator so can do that
you can't do it when it's in the absolute value
though
well did right there is that why missed it
but see if you wanna do that then at first you bring
so only did one part of it in other words
mhm just bring nega just bring twothirds over to the other side negative twothirds over to the other side
make it equal to zero
no keep that there but then have
another one over there
have is less than or equal to negative two thirds and that's not absolute value anymore
well see we've never done it like that
let me see if that's how you do it
mean i'm sure you probably can do it that way
don't know if that's how you do it or not cause haven't done this in probably about as long as you have oops god
it's my own fault shouldn't have waited so long to get math over with should've got it over with right out right out of high school
bug
hey leah she looks so tired
know
she's eating that bug
is that what she's doing
yuck guess yeah that's how you do it
you can do it that way
mhm
let me see the pencil
but then didn't get what she got guess she yeah you can put it so square root of that oh no it's not gonna work that way you don't have it in the middle see put it in the middle seven halves is greater than or equal to but you can't put it in the middle cause if it's gonna be g yeah if it's gonna be greater than that then it's not gonna be less than that well guess it can
god so one way could do it
well s no wait a minute now see l look what she did she um flipped that sign over but uh when she you divide by negative two you have to flip all the signs over which you k did yeah cause you got that right it's right here
oh gosh you know what i'm just gonna skip this one
you're not you're gonna do it now
so can't start by d
unhunh not finding a common denominator you have to ha bring
well can do find one side by doing that can't
but why don't you p just put the other put once you have negative twothirds on the other side then you can find a common denom f na buh buh buh buh common denominator for the whole thing and it's gonna be the same denominator
well what's the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh
didn't mean that meant once you bring it over there
know what you meant don't ever remember us doing anything like that though well add it onto the other side there's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars in problems isn't there hey can use some of this
oh yeah mm see yeah here it's absolute values right here
it's doing it the way that you were doing it
i'm trying to find one like that one
see that's the problem there's so many different types that i'm sitting here st worrying about this one right here and there probably won't even be l one like this on the test
know
there'll be a different one
so what do you do you find a inequality with an absolute value in it which there's one right there mhm see sure didn't see any in the
examples
hmm see there's no there it is
see here it is absolute value of that you brought brought negative four over to the other side
ay
all that
see that just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never gone over know we've never done one like that where you do that can you do you wanna do that when it's less than or can you do that when it's greater than too
th either way
so if it's pointed this way you just put another one pointing this way over here
right
ay
where'd you get that one that's a big one
you're not kidding
that's my thumbnail
now just get a common denominator for the whole thing
mhm well take out those absolute value things they'll screw you
and now this'll be six right is that right
mhm
w what do you do
subtract three from the middle
y to which side
to both sides
to both sides okay
negative
two ex
alright to one then after that you have to take out the negatives
divide by well just ta divide by negative two
oh you can't get that by
ex by itself
when you divide by a negative
you have to flip the signs
okay
when you do that it's gonna be a or because if you look at it cause you know it can't be greater than sevenhalves and less than negative halve at the sa onehalf at the same time so it's gonna be either ex is less than or equal to negative onehalf or
ay
will you pass me some of that tea please oh thank you number ten how many problems are on this test
twelve
oh good
what did you want to do after this test
that's it guess
you gonna study some more tomorrow then right
oh definitely
ay ex plus four over three ex minus two is less than zero
is less than zero
right
gosh is this the c is this the same class i'm taking kathy are you sure we're doing work from the same class that i'm that i'm that go to every night
don't know are we it's got the same name but that's about it okay
don't even know how you start this one do you
think so but i'm not sure cause the way start it
do did have anything written on the test
mm
but but anyways back to the the first thing
ay
what we were talking about was
i've gotta pickup pat
l dropped her off at the bookkeeper
uh
uh would prefer that that you were there on one hand because think that it would be most expedient but think what was felt was that at this point rather than ha than create don't really f find it to be you know a confrontation by any means but
mhm
just think they wanna be able to just kind of figure out think our board eh quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior than we do outside of it
hm
think most of it is just attitudes
hm
think you know like said what we need to do is this board has to realize in my opinion that that they have to come to grips with the fact that they are responsible for basically what they've created
mhm
ay you know
mhm
you can't th penalize somebody for m
the vetters are somewhat responsible
that's right
that's uh
mhm
well it was far beyond our control
well and the thing is mean
that uh
we're we're a different board we are not the same
we have to do that
that's right
but we have to realize that there's the faults here we have to claim responsibilities mean
mhm
think there was there's manners of of speaking that was very outspoken about at this meeting you know w that talked to uh bill and carmela and nancy about you know and they we did they asked me to meet with them about teresa's thing
mhm
that find v really nothing to be honest nothing of any validity
well you know
ay
have spoken twice with teresa
did you unhunh
told her exactly well i t simply told her what what know to have happ and it's to me it's n just ludicrous and anyway we w we went through the whole thing and uh and and also said that it would probably be brought up at board retreat or don't know uh
well i'm gonna write a letter to teresa
uh um
just to tell her that l you know d thank you for your l you know y what you've done for the board and so forth
mhm
just say you know i'm hoping we are gonna address this letter of concerns that you've given us
mhm
um she's asked that you know she want she didn't really want her things to be kind of everywhere you know those th
mhm
what her comments she really wanted em to be within this p committee
mhm
my f
summarized or something like that guess
they were her summar her summary th you know she kyu very m very concisely
don't know if she put it together or if nancy put it together but
mhm
you know that just says they d really had a ho everybody there including nancy
mhm
you know uh had very little to to you know to agree with the validity okay
it was a matter of just don't you know see where this is coming from
it's
ay you know these are these are rooted
know jeez
obviously in a personal issue
um teresa is a very sensitive person she f you know don't have no doubt that she believes what happened happened but
well but
my my feeling is as told them said if it's that issue says you know said let's just get real here said
we all know brad said we all know teresa said and don't know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around teresa period
unhunh
says don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature said and there it was very clear you know she kept saying prefacing everything with you know this is not a personal attack this is not a personal vendetta
yeah yeah yeah right right
which tells you that it is
that's immediately what it said and that's what everybody perceived it
there
there have been some uh i'll te well it goes back to if you can believe it ha know she there was a a we had a number of people once at a party uh like half of the board it was a big mistake of mine
know she felt really snubbed and uh
mhm
it was and called her in fact later and said teresa thi this was not a w invited people that helped with the market that year
mhm think it was two years ago and know mean that wa really upset her and jeez if that's gonna upset her uh
well that's that's the thing that
but anyway
that see and the other thing that i've gotta do too is wanna make sure like for example donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
mhm
see have not called her but i'm gonna call her to tell her that
mhm yeah
you know we're having a board retreat you know
right that it's not gonna include staff if that's what we decide
right unhunh
what we will do is think what we're gonna probably wanna do or what would like to do is would like to take a day
mhm
d during the week and we'll just take a whole day that day and myself uh if we have a uh facilitator
mhm
um that that person you and patricia and donna
mhm
maybe one other or two other board members would actually spend that day and just say okay this is what went on at that retreat
mhm
these are the concerns
these were comments these are the ones that we feel we can address these are the ones that pertain to you
unhunh yeah
am concerned phil that you mentioned it yesterday that that there may be a number of questions that just cannot be answered without me being there
think it's
hi gato
you know i'm gonna have
ay
can we talk l uh bet pat's gonna she's gonna start walking back to the office
dropped her at the bookkeeper
w why don't you call me at least a little bit later maybe
we can go do that
can do that cause she'll be
ji jim and are gonna have lunch
uh don't want to get her uh
don't know if you have plans or not but we're gonna have lunch later
at noon
hx
if you wanna join us it'd be great
yeah
um
you wanna do it where what's the
you know don't my my feeling is i'm trying to think what wanna do is my my point of wanting to push this retreat think it was really important was
mhm
to do it to e to make it sound like we're taking it seriously
oh yeah
but to also put into perspective and see w that was one point of view why
you know like said d d the facilitator in in the beginning did not wasn't really in support of one and only because felt
mhm
wanna make it sound important
it would formalize it too much or
want it formalizing it but it's also say want it to come to the resolution that things aren't that bad
mhm no
that what
what we and things aren't that bad the thing is that we h do have our attitudes
mhm mhm
ay
mhm
we have an attitude you know even what ray's attitude with with barbara
mhm
is completely unheard of you know and i'm that bothers me a great deal
jeez just couldn't believe that
when heard it
had you know came real close to calling ray and just sitting and talking with him about it
but figured no
i'm just gonna blow it off
think he's off the board
i'm gonna blow it off
he's
i'm not gonna give m
you know we've done everything we needed to do
right
right
think you know what barbara told me was that dolores was incredibly embarrassed by his display at this time in front of her dolores apologized for ray to him
really oh gee
so dolores is obviously aware that
oh gosh
you know and
she says don't know why he resigned
don't know what's got in
because he's been miserable
because w which we know
mhm
that's why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound you know like he and nyou know he was trying to make it sound like same old complaint same old everything well we didn't have any complaints
yeah
think this is one of the first years
know
that this has been so smooth and think had we realized it
mhm
we would have allowed him to take a break four years ago
yeah
because and it wasn't so much it wasn't you know like told jim said it wasn't anything that you did wasn't anything else
mhm
said it was a matter of you know mbrad did and pat did the organization said which was the best thing th agree with that
mhm
think that was the best thing to do
mhm
it was a lot of time
but think we need to we need to d establish duties
mhm
you know which we decided and see part of what we decided with these duties is just deciding what we need to do what you know there's gonna be tasks
mhm
as specifically as we ca
see and i'm i'm on one hand i'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
unhunh
you know pat does that
know there's really the secretary serves almost no function
just i th not
you know it's just uh
there signs she signs her name thirty times
you know in the last f y
right right phil
two days ago well
that was it that was it
that's a problem
that um
you know and think we wanna do that we need to say you know pat's been great enough to do this and if she really wants to do it i'm not gonna dissuade her from doing it
but one thing we have to be careful of
that mentioned to jim and i've mentioned it to pat lightly
which is to be careful about saying things you know like in board meetings in interjecting too much
ay
know
because in board discussion mean
o on one hand as a member she has every right to to speak what she wants but
mhm
but that's
the thing is you know i've just seen some of the looks from some of the people you know who feel i'm a board member
whether the board you know if they don't interject anything but whether they do or not think we have to be careful
mhm well phil that mean that goes
be because where that came in
that goes for me as well then it
it does but
it um
think what's different is you
um
you've been much more responsive in this sense
mean
ay pat's more opinionated in that sense
you know unhunh
ay
what try to do is is is just respond to question
if need to fill in blanks which
oh yeah that's fine
you know
that
but
see but that your your position is different
mhm
ay
that's yeah that's true
yours is in a is a much more official capacity because you are the one who answers to the board
right
you have to do that and you are th can voice an opinion about things
but the biggest deal where thought it was an issue th where heard things about it was during the annual meeting right after when we had the discussion about the poster
oh
when we brought up the thing
was pat uh
pat was right in the middle of it
see wasn't there
she was saying well this is a great piece and this is this well
you know didn't wanna embarrass her
she shouldn't have done that
didn't wanna do anything
know
but just saw people kinda going
that was out yeah
you know

that's true she shouldn't've been in on that at all
she shouldn't've been you know cause that's not part of her capacity she's not on that committee
mhm mhm
you know and if she wants you know basically the thing is you know if she wanted to be a board person
mhm
that's fine mean let's look into b pursuing that
right right
but see i'm afraid we're gonna lose jim because of that he feels there's a conflict and uh it's definitely gonna happen
mean he says there's no question about it we've talked
and maybe it's right maybe it s it is gonna be right
you know
well he d mean he doesn't seem to you've talked to him and i've talked to him and
well he seems to be
mean he says mayb you know after the board retreat now
but not
well a
you know
wanted him said want you to stay through the board retreat
says and the reason is because said we need people who know said right now we have you know four new board members or five
you know
four whatever
four new board yeah
we're at this point of saying okay uh all of a sudden we have t all these you know questions to answer
mhm
you know we have all these things that we have to do
mhm
we have this commitment of time uh and but they don't know everything that's gone on in the last years
they need to be educated as to
see this
no
this retreat that's why you see think it's important because mean realized that i'd never seen the bylaws since was on the board until asked for a copy
mhm mhm right yeah now what what have done though is to you know any new board member that jumps on send them
good
copies of the
because wanna
wanna get these books
but ty typically they no one reads em
well that's fine
you know but it's at least they've got
but think what wanna do is i'm gonna wanna draft a letter
mhm
like said which
mhm
says to them you know this is what we're doing this is the purpose of this retreat
mhm
to new board members and you know board members for a while it was we need to find out what it is we're doing
whether we're doing something right or not you know
right
right
think we are but
oh yeah sure we are
think
we are
the thing is don't need to b them to kind of commit to to being responsible
mhm yeah
uh mean kinda hate to feel like i'm taking charge but th guess that's what i'm i'm needing to do
well yeah for
you know but
y y you do and you're
that's kind of why i'm
you're present
i'm going to assign things
unhunh
you know at some point we're gonna have committees and we're gonna have you know
mhm
b people that'll be given tasks
you know specifically
like you know didn't need to do all this calling aro to find a r a r retreat space but figured if don't do it
that's right
it's gonna fall on you or pat
of course yeah
you know
normally that's that's what happens
that's okay but
mean uh
you know i'm a i'm a i'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on you know
know that you're getting ready to leave and pat's doing things so i'd better let you go get her
know okay
we'll continue this
well yeah there
in some manner but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want but think
that's fine
if we can
that's fine
if we can go ahead and carry on
um
at some point you and think
because
one thing that comes to mind is is the well the question of meeting quarterly is that enough meaning having you know the
it would be enough if committees were to meet
uh if committees yeah and that's the
but
that that's that was paul's uh desire
think
was uh
that's what we wanna talk ab
we'll talk about that there too and say look
mhm
you know is quarterly you know we would we need to meet every other month
mhm
you know do we need t do we need to meet you know
as a full board every oth w we shouldn't have to
we shouldn't
if the committees uh
but these committees need to be active
function properly
to do their things
right
basically you know the publications committee needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish
you know
they need to become somewhat selfsufficient collections committee
needs you know would like to create collections committee to be something where we're almost matching
funds they can raise maybe
unhunh yeah
you know if they can raise ten grand
well
you know
have some
mean realistically
have some incentive
right
for them to yeah
so that basically they'd be they'd get to a point of saying
mhm
ay we need to be responsible with this so that collections
publications will be all fund raising too
right
oh boy phil that's
it's not gonna be pretty
that's where
because that's
you know also we may consider you know we have one board opening and we may think about gail
well gail is very interested and so is this we met with another person by the name of bill ashby
hm yeah know
jack and and jim met with him
oh you mean his jack's financial friend that
jack's friend
is retired
he's a banker
he'd be good on one hand but
would like ideally i'd want em both
yeah
you know and i'm hoping
what i'm gonna what i'm anticipating doing is uh this retreat might urge people to say i'm not interested in doing that much work
and so i'm getting yeah
it might just f get like nancy and kay mean like kay
see nancy was going off she she told me she was going off this year and she uh
kay convinced said well nancy you can't leave right away and uh uh she said okay i'll stay another year but don't know why
you know and and then we can why tha think that's very important to discuss at the board retreat
think it is because mean the thing is that we need to get to a point and the reason we've set terms is because basically people here
mhm
majority of us have been here a long time
that's right
you know and there's a point
well that's why we have this the term limitation
unhunh
i'm i'm uh full agreement cause i'm ready you know
i've agreed to do this term
mhm
but
mhm
my feeling is i'm ready for a year off
you know
mhm
i'll still be volunteering but really am ready for some time to say
mhm
you know and wanted jim to consider being market manager even if he goes off the board
know he was wavering a little bit on that whether or not he would volunteer at the marketing center
mean there's
i've gotta run now
ay j see you brad
um but the lun uh
we're gonna meet here
oh you're gonna have x
so we can d either swing by for you or we can decide we'll call you
oh so you're not
when know what we're doing if you want
ay that'd be great alright
sam has been has taken such an interest in this retirement bit that it it really surprises me
well she's begun to listen
she has
you know
she has
uh she used to go over and read a book
or
or something
b turn a deaf ear that was for sure
but uh once you understand it you know you
you're interested in getting right in and going after it
really oughta call at least reg barr and ask if uh he's still speaking to me
well now he was the one that was up on the left
up there
yes
well he came over to you all smiles noticed
nyes well we've known each other for thirty some years why wouldn't he but a anyway um was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit because it was burns that's been objecting to our having it
oh
knew this so when he opened up on that and she followed through and told about her husband you know
t necessarily that she would approve of it but at least she wasn't disapproving
of it
uh course duvall might and cannot get over this that man really cannot and you know he must have been thinking when he said he wasn't a political appointee he must have been associating his relationship with steitler
oh
really do believe that
mhm
in his thinking don't know how else he could have done it that topples over
um
but he didn't say that
oh
he said loved your hum humor uh and love you but am not a political appointee and his eyes were just snapping
said oh
how did you get on the board
well he said got a letter from the governor asking
everybody on there is an app political appointee
that wasn't the point
the point was could have mentioned what was in the paper about him that he was related you know had business with steitler and just said and there's doctor duvall you know
then went to rotus who's a seasoned politician
if there ever was one he just would flare and said well alright said i'll apologize next time and i'm gonna make hay out of it don't you worry
wanna know how you birds got on that board if you're not political appointees
mm
oh my
can grow some basil from seed
that's how i've don't have any this year but i've grown it other years
well
there's no problem it will not take any frost soon as the b
little bit of frost it's gone
l learned that one time the
learned it just went down
the hard way hm uh huh
well think it was barbara that has some seeds
just no problem it comes right
yeah
isn't that what you gave the neighbor one time
you gave him some kind of herb
did give him some gave him a red pepper
think you think you gave him some herb of some kind
may have given given him some basil yes
don't have any this year forgot to plant it have oregano
a good stand of it if you want any
have a lot of dried or oregano
is your cigarette out everybody's
it's out
you smoked it down into the cork didn't you
pardon
you smoked it down into the cork
well yeah you don't like that
do you but
it chokes me to death
it's
it's there might as well smoke it
oh
good
good uh
how's ted doing
he's keeping very busy he's on mostly uh evening hours
mhm
they're redoing the pharmacy there at wel wallmart
oh
enlarging it and
well
it's close to the garden shop and so the fellows in the garden shop and the pet shop have to move things out from that area
oh
into the garden shop so they can work on the pharmacy
well they needed to expand the pharmacy i've never been there but what had to wait and wait and wait
so don't
where are they putting the pharmacy
well they're b leaving it in the same place they're just taking out two rows of of uh
where the toiletries were
just inventory stuff moving it
they're they're moving that don't know where where they're going to put all that
hm
but ted says there's not much garden left
just all of this stuff out in there he works uh six days next week instead of five days
he only gets one day off
hm mhm
he's off today
mhm
uh
well
but he hasn't had day hours he's been working evening hours and weekends
you know think i'd hate to be in business right now

you can't sit still
hmm
you have to expand or something
to keep in the main stream
well and so many times when they expand they've expanded and then things dropped back
but this wallmart needs needs a larger building
it's just too cramped
your shirt and beads are most becoming
well you know think they weigh about a quarter of an ounce and that's the right kind of beads
unhunh for summer
little girl the other day remarked about them and almost on impulse but didn't do it thought i'd pull em off just give em to her if she liked em that well
you know but then thought these are the only summer beads have
right and like like that b shirt
you know what had to do this
what did you
this see where sewed right down the middle of that
otherwise it would balloon out and so s put it on the machine and sewed right down through the middle of it
so it doesn't gap
so it d doesn't gap right
oh smart
well it works
smart
it had a it had a one of those bottoms that
oh
are what do you call it
tail
the tight it the band
oh
the t the tight band around the bottom of it
band
don't like those
don't either
makes your butt look thin
most all of em are that way
makes your hei
do you know
makes your heinie look thinner
went over to a store where it says
uh sewing alterations and all that stuff and said how much do you charge for taking that bottom band off the top you know and just making it a straight shirt and she said eight dollars and thought oh my lord didn't pay that much for the top i've got on
you know that's a little like these catalog things saw something in a cat the catalog this deal that i've been with for a long time and wanted to buy it it was a m m like a muumuu
mhm
weren't those pretty ones up in dillards the other day those muumuus did you notice em didn't you notice em as you went out all beautiful colors so pretty well anyway they were on the rack and uh wanted to order that muumuu mean it was around twentynine dollars or something like that and two pairs of short pajamas one for sam and one for me and looked at the postage attached to it
thought good heavens it would have been around eight dollar it's by amounts of money not weight it's by money how much money this costs and it's geared according to that and thought forget it could take that eight dollars and buy another whole outfit
you know this is amazing uh like to get um pillow covers that you zip on to protect the pillows
mhm mhm
uh went over to sears one time and ordered three through the catalog and instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything
paid postage on it separate
do you know the postage came to more
than the g than the product
more than the product
right right
well w that's one of the letters that i'm going to write to and just tell them
that they're gearing this in the wrong way it should be geared according to weight now that g cotton two pairs of cotton pajamas and that cotton muumuu ain't gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth believe you me
wouldn't think no
know better so thought th just won't order from em m that's foolish
we better go up to dillards and see if they still have those muumuus
you mean up to phoenix
well they might have them here in town
don't know
at dillards
they they were sure pretty pretty c pretty colors some of em were dark
yeah
but they had oh purples and reds and pinks and oh pretty designs in em
hm
you didn't see em
don't think was was think was concerned about your getting there and back
oh
oh hunh
you're not the only one baby
you weren't the only one
sam was just dripping was just soaked
buckets
was just absolutely soaked wasn't
she c came in and sat down in the restaurant
you know and spent the first ten or fifteen minutes
stopping the flow of trickling down her neck
oh
oh terrible just terrible
oh well
my other doris does the same thing
oh does she
yeah
well what is it
don't know she doesn't know
well some people just perspire
well didn't persp use to perspire like that
more
but sure have done it
not to that extent you didn't
recently th that and the time we were up in uh montgomery wards remember
oh yes
oh boy was soaked
that was just
that was in the winter
weakness exertion
well maybe that's what this was but anyway
wish the stores would open earlier
earlier yes do too
instead of ten o'clock in the summertime they oughta open at least at nine
well it would he
i'd say eight
it would help eight o'clock would be fine
you hate to start out at ten o'clock
i'd say eight and quit at four
you know the little folks who live above me
mhm
go over to tucson mall and walk every morning
yeah that's good
there's a side door
mhm
unlocked so that they can go in oh think
lotta people do that
they go r uh at least by eight o'clock
yeah
they go in
they go in and walk
then they know so many times around you know
mhm mhm
will um make a mile and then there's a soft drink place up there that they all congregate
oh
uh
why don't you join em
they have pins when they cover fifty miles or whatever you know
a hundred miles of
what outfit is this from oasis
it's a
it's just a neighborhood thing it's just people around in that area
it's ne
they go there to walk
think think that's it but uh uh we've been over there and we've seen em go in and all they're doing is just walking
mhm they might be good people we could cultivate to hunt things for us

you mean look in the window
w that's that's an idea
instead of having to parade all around looking for it
they're around why not tell us where that is
well yeah well they can explain
they can take notes
as they go around

so they put a whole new mechanism in on side
hm
wasn't prepared for them to
was going to tip them but wasn't prepared to b buy the chair over again
so

gave em ten dollars but that's all had
well that was enough
guess that was enough
they're on salary with the c with the company anyway
sure
but they were so jovial and
was that spring from your seat or the back of th your chair
nice now it was a a tight little spring that um
governed the mechanism and held the chair together when you put out
oh the footrest
the footrest and told well think told you this phoned her and said don't know whether can sit in the chair at all or not and said and besides when go by it it snarls at me
what else politics deals with the question of power right that's the introduction to empowerment what is power very quickly come on all of you should know these two concepts they're not that difficult what is power what are we talking about
having the capacity to impact public policy
alright so if we're talking about politics politics is tied into the whole concept of power right and if we're talking about empowerment as a concept we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power now does power come in one form does it come in many different forms
different
different forms back here what forms give me examples of power either one of you
education knowledge
alright knowledge
knowledge
ay what else
um
money
um your position in the workforce um
ay
i'm trying to think of the word
alright close right
wealth numbers
wealth
numbers of people
numbers of people right what else
social status
social status position right if you're the chairperson of um a major corporation would you say that that person has some power
most definitely
alright especially if you're in uh or general motors or chrysler corporation and
think in some some t some examples some gender and race can give you power
gender race alright
gender
let's deal with that alright gender race let's talk about race in terms of power if make the statement which did that there's no fear factor when it comes to the chicanolatino community and there is much more of a fear factor in dealing with the africanamerican community am not dealing with a racial factor of power
why
because it's gonna affect the decision making process the politics and um the policy
alright
africa in um i kinda like in past africanamericans have been more organized and have had more leaders or not more leaders but who have more leaders who've been known or something
more recognized
like martin luther king
that's right
more recognized and
alright
think that's a fear factor
that is a part of the fear factor
mhm
mean uh if one looks at what uh jesse jackson is doing vis a vis who the major league baseball teams and all that football and all that what's his underlying argument what's his criticism that there're not sufficient numbers of what
blacks
well he says minorities he's smart he's talks about minorities but he's really talking about africanamericans
in the uh managerial process of
right
of professional sports
exactly managerial owners managers et cetera right alright have you heard of a latino say this or would a jesse jackson have said that about latinos hm no unhunh we haven't and uh we're gonna get into that in our discussion alright so the whole notion of power is very important to understand because here am making some statements alright some generalities that some people would say are not true mean how can doctor montoya say that latinos have no no real power no fear factor after all they have two people that are cabinet members they have supervisor here in los angeles they have city council people in los angeles and yet he's saying that they have no power well power is relative as well right it's relative it's relational power is relational how can you measure power power is impossible to measure alright in other words you cannot break power apart into vi various ingredients and say these are the ingredients of power we can make generalities position wealth all these different things that i've talked about but power is difficult to measure so that we must deal with the whole question of empowerment from also the perspective of potential power versus actual power there is a difference if am for example the president of a major labor union or a major corporation the position as president of that entity gives me so much power but yet if do not know how to utilize that entity in terms of its mobilization for a given objective like a labor union if have fourteen million people as members and don't show any manifestation of power am powerful well it has to be measured by what you're trying to do what the objectives are example labor today is being challenged by perhaps one of the most serious pieces of not legislation per se because it's not in a legislative form yet but a proposed north american free trade agreement that if passed by congress is going to impact three economies canada and mexico labor as a sector is going to be the most impacted how is labor today mobilizing its great power uh not just the and its fourteen million members but the united auto workers and many other or labor organizations what are they doing to influence public policy
combining power
huh
they're combining their power
how are they combining their power
by al allying with other um unions of workers
alright they're they're they're forming coalitions among themselves they're forming coalitions with who environmental groups right cause environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted especially along the border alright so there's there's a lot of coalition building but can you say as a historian that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago taking to the streets
no they've definitely lost power
alright good point they have he said they have lost power so your measurement of a loss of power is based on what
what they can and can't
alright alright you don't see what you've read about right
right
today alright that's one perception is the black community less powerful today in nineteenninetythree than it was in nineteen sixty eight with the poor people's march on washington or nineteensixtythree again on the w uh march uh to washington on washington when martin luther king gave his famous speech have a dream there were three hundred thousand people at that march in nineteensixtythree which period of time historically speaking was a time where blacks were manifesting much more power today or nineteensixtythree or nineteensixtyeight when
when they m manifest they're beginning to get more power
when uh in in comp in in
w
when do uh make a comparison nineteenninetythree nineteensixtyeight nineteensixtythree during those three periods when would you say blacks demonstrated much more power
w they have more power now
they have more power why do you say that
cause they're more recognized mean
does recognition give you power hm
to a to some aspects yeah think think the the problem with your question is s a different sort of powers
ah very good explain that
you have uh you have africanamericans more institutionalized in our system now
ah
than they were in sixtyeight
alright stop right there today they have how many congressmen thirty eight thirty eight congressional representatives don't know how many they had in nineteensixtythree i'm not even gonna try to guess but uh probably no more than two or three if they were lucky alright would you say that
would say that's right
alright go on what else
in sixtyeight the blacks were a whole lot more mobile mobilized much better mobilized threehundredthousand marching on washington is an example you probably couldn't get that today
ay alright
you know with xchicanos the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteenseventy during the era of the vietnam war twentyfivethousand chicanos were mobilized in los angeles a at the national chicano moratorium against the war no one has come even close with the exception of the death of cesar chavez recently where there were approximately fortythousand people to mobilize large numbers of people into some kind of a effort or movement alright so he's correct it depends on the time depends on the circumstances and the form of power institutionalized power is different from the unconventional form that uh y you just described alright well what we're trying to get at is potential versus actual my argument as humble as it is is that chicanos in nineteenninetythree are fast developing a high potential for power but they're a long way from actualizing their true power okay in other words they're we're still at the potential phase of our empowerment and not at the actual power phase alright anything else on those two concepts alright let's get into discussion on voter participation and these are kind of general comments don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics but i'll give you some general uh trends some statistical information that will prove a point that will introduce the subject of political participation in the united states now a democracy the participation of the citizenry is imperative it is absolutely imperative if it's to be a democracy to have the people participate now what am trying to say what am trying to say it is imperative for the people to participate in the political process another way of saying it what am saying
we have to vote everyone
but why is it important in a democracy for the people to participate just deal with the question not the methods
you mean because if the people don't vote it will be there will be an elite group it'll be more of a monarchy that has control it won't be a democracy
ay what's a monarchy
kings
one ruler
well one
royalty
what
one ruler
royalty or one family
alright close there's a royal type of family right king
t elected alright hereditary et cetera et cetera alright but what am getting at what's the essence of what i'm asking for yes fire away
by its very nature democracy demands voting without voting
ah stop right there you made a statement by the very nature of democracy what is a democracy
democracy is rule by the people
alright demos cratos right people rule
another greek word the greeks were major contributors to this political process of development of concepts demos cratos people govern or people rule alright we tell the world that democracy is what we practice is that correct is that what we tell the world
alright would you agree with that okay what else do we say selling our political system in selling our political system we make it synonymous synonymous by saying that we don't distinguish the form of economic system versus the political system and that we put it in the same kettle democracy and capitalism are essentially the same are they the same
but yet we do and if we listen carefully and read carefully all these books on international relations foreign relations and so forth what is it that we tell the world that america is the cradle of democracy we are the cradle of democracy we are the bastion of the free world et cetera et cetera et cetera and when ronald reagan was in power we talked about the evil empire right categorizing uh the soviet union and the socalled communist empire as a evil empire alright say this because there is a tendency for some of us to believe because we have been conditioned right who conditions us to think the way we think what did we deci what did we say earlier talking about culture
um they learn through schools through their families
schools right schools the media everything else mean doesn't the media tell us that there's only a twoparty system in this country
mhm
mhm why is it that the communist party the socialist workers party the prohibitionist party the american independent party all these parties that we have supposedly minority parties don't get the same kind of treatment as the democratic and republican parties they're not mainstream right we have a twoparty system we are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties that's a l different subject but i'm what i'm the point i'm trying to make is that if we look into the realities of what we have as a political system we tell the world that in this country democracy is very much alive because we have a congress we have a supreme court we have a presidency we have a political system that is governed by certain principles and laws that emanate from what the constitution which is a living document the constitution right that is very much the document that protects conceptually and otherwise our way of life our democracy and so forth well if we remember our chicano history my point as we get into the whole question of chicano political participation is that it's difficult for us as chicanos as we get into it to understand why is it including ourselves because a lot of chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote why don't we participate and they come up with all kinds of somewhat superficial analysis that much of our political behavior is a product of what was covered in this class under history and culture and what did say two major currents of history two major currents of political culture right and what is political culture i'll get back to that concept but just general terms what is political culture what is political culture alright want you to think put that concept down because you're gonna you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes it's very important that you understand that concept political culture but want thing want to underline here is that we are products of a historical dualistic process mexico's history history we're a pr we're products of what cultural process that's also mexican and american whatever american means alright so those two major ingredients have molded the rationale that i'm using in this class to explain why is it that we're still at the potential phase of empowerment and we still have a long ways to go before we realize that concept that describe called empowerment but before we get into that s substance of that is that wanna just briefly cover that even though i'm saying that chicanos do not vote in great numbers and we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers the fact is as mentioned earlier that even though we tell the world we are this beacon of light of freedom of liberty justice and all these different things by and large not a lot of people participate politically across the board don't care if you're africanamerican don't care if you're asianamerican and don't care if you're latino or whatever most americans do not vote in great numbers so it's a double whammy introducing the subject matter here americans in comparison to great britain in comparison to france in comparison to germany in comparison to italy we don't vote in the numbers that they do alright mean if we had more time could give you statistic after statistic italy for example has a voter turnout of ninety percent of those that are eligible to vote we're lucky if we get fifty percent are we less democratic are they more democratic why is it that italy has a much larger a higher voter level of participation or germany or even canada seventy percent the fact is that democracy in this country is dying want you to put that down cause it's gonna be important at least for my analysis don't want you to agree or disagree at this point just write it down you have plenty of time one week to think about it american democracy is dying want you to put that whole phrase in black and white american democracy is dying and want you to try to think of why as we get into the discussion of chicano participation and we'll get back to that statement next week so for us as chicanos it's a double jeopardy that's another point wanna underscore because if the larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole and you're at the bottom you're at the very bottom with all the problems of poverty and all the social problems that we're we've been talking about it's understandable why perhaps chicanos do not vote or participate in great numbers now the literature in political science dealing with factors influence influencing voting are many are many civic culture almond and verba nineteenseventytwo or so is one book that you can look at um there's a book by raymond wolfinger steven ronsteen ronstone i'm sorry who votes that's another book okay the literature goes on and on but all want to do in terms of just giving you some idea of what are the factors that influence peoples' participation in the political process of this country and there are essentially five you can probably develop more but these are general categories most of the literature in political science and think mister verba would agree with me on this that people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty what does that mean sense of duty they regard participation as important now why would you say that this is a factor that influences voting now this is a very somewhat altruistic uh value right sense of duty why why would you say that people in this country have a some people that vote
vote because they have a sense of duty why right here
don't know probably it stems mostly from your education your childhood when your told you're an american citizen and it's your civic duty you know towards other people and you know getting the government going to vote and put your two cents in because without you then y we won't have government same sense of jury duty too jury
ay good point
duty
as we go through some of these these five want you to think of the agents of socialization because then want you to think when we get into the discussion on chicanos how do those agents affect us as chicanos alright number one sense of duty who is responsible for inculcating that sense of duty one the family alright remember the family is your primary agent two the educational institutions mean from the time that you start kindergarten to the time that you graduate from the university it's constant not constant but somewhat of a consistent bombardment of values attitudes et cetera reinforcing the nature of the political system and the virtues of participating in the political process so in essence what i'm saying is you acquire this through the socialization process that we've discussed already yes
think that it's more eyeopening to see that this doesn't exist more than it does and that's why people don't vote it seems that mean you talk to people they have an attitude can't make a difference that's why don't vote it's not my responsibility that's why don't vote there's not a sense of duty even though like you said from the beginning supposedly we're getting it all through school
why do you suppose that has changed and this is a much of a recent phenomena much more because you've had declining voter participation levels since the nineteenseventies and i'm giving you the answer wa what what what has been the problem contributing to what you just said
well agree agree with what he was saying but think m maybe one of the reasons could be they're not being represented they don't think they're being represented they don't um see any like direct results for them you know coming out of like
mhm
the representation the government and who's in control
ay
think n
that's
you know there are a lot of people
alright
mean
that's would you agree with that
lot of people
mhm
they vote their pocketbook
they they're they vote their pocketbook
they vote definitely their pocketbook alright that's true what would you add to f
well you say we're not represented it's like we say there's not much choice between say like the last um you know you voted for clinton or you know you know whatever his name was
bush
bush in a bush
don't think
the other guy
don't think there's as much trust
oh perot
trust
trust in the system
why
lot more corruption mean you had nixon
why
to watergate
what did you have in the seventies now l let's talk about that what what did what did what did we have
ay
you
well in the beginning well even in the late sixties you had vietnam you had uh
good excellent what did vietnam do
turned uh the youth especially against the government policies the educated youth more so and those were think the people that were gonna be voting as they went on they lost faith in the system they lost faith in their leaders
alright alright on that score would you say that most of you without getting personal here are products uh in terms of birth of the sixties all of you were born in the sixties early seventies right so that means that most of your parents
were very much a part of the era of the sixties right alright would you say go back to you that your parents were very much influenced by the vietnam war one way or the other
which which way which direction
um total apathy
total apathy
why
um well my mom total apathy uh she just th don't know think she just got burned out she got sick and tired of you know turning on the news and seeing another corrupt man or another you know another scandal breaking out she knew friends that were dying in viet you know she had friends that were drafted were sent were dying and she didn't you know she didn't believe in the system and she just didn't care anymore think it was just a lot of negatives had built
ay
she just let it go
ay how about you how about your parents
um well my dad was drafted
he was in vietnam
um long story he didn't make it to vietnam but um
but he was in the military during that time
he was in the military at the time
alright
ay
my mom claims she was too young to know but don't know
ay
um don't know how my dad really felt about it know we come from a long line of military men so he kind of felt a sense of duty so um
was there a sense of betrayal
possibly yeah
mhm
is that just carbonated water
thank you no
this is cream soda
it's cream soda
oh boy
the best
it's the best i'm sure
does it look like cream soda
why do these cans get so warped only the only the sam's club cans get so warped
think you should write
cause they're
cause they're cheap cans
just write a letter to em
that's why
complain marci
what i'm gonna complain about is that they don't make white grape this stuff is good
it's like sparkling grape juice cocktail or something you know remember that white
they only make that with nutrasweet though do don't they they don't make a regular
regular grape don't know
every time i've looked at the bot that bottled water or the sparkling water it's all with
but they don't make this kind at all anymore
