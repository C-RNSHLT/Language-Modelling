fourteen seventy five so okay so i'm better off ordering a um a um like a special then right because your ad said it's a fan favorite special it's large then

with two dipping sauces six cans of pop and then i would suggest you add the ten wings on to that
oh that's better
it would be a bit better yes
oh okay yeah thank you i'll i'll go with that then like how much is that one
uh give me a second it starts off at twenty four fifty but with the _garbled you have it will be a little bit more
that's fine now if you could ring those yeah
yeah one second
yeah
just bear with me for a second i'm just changing everything over
yeah sure yeah
so the special with your toppings would be thirty dollars and twenty cents for the two large pizzas
oh
<cont> it will be ninety five to add ten wings
oh okay then i don't want that i i would rather have a like um
it's just cheaper _garbled two pizzas
yeah
so now here i'll compare some prices for you so if you do the two pizza special like i'm suggesting with ten wings added on
yes yes
it would be about forty dollars and five cents
it'll be what i'm sorry
forty dollars and five cents plus tax and delivery
sure yes
or plus taxes i mean
yeah yeah yeah yes
now if you do it the way you asked
yes
it would be forty two dollars
oh okay then then then we go with the best way right the one you had suggested then
yeah and it's got the two flavors i want right yup
that gives you both flavors that you want and then you also get six pop instead of four
oh great and ten wings
<cont> then yes the ten wings
yeah that that's perfect
<cont> you also get two dipping sauces did you want both blue cheese
yeah we can keep the dipping sauce the flavor i i i _garbled
so i'm just gonna verify the order with you
yeah
so i have two large pizzas first one is the spicy barbecue chicken which is onion hot peppers grilled chicken and barbecue sauce
yes
the second one is the sweat heat which is pineapple hot peppers and grilled chicken
yes
then you have the six nestea two blue cheese and then we have ten wings breaded with honey garlic on the side
yeah
thanks um i have i have seven people is that is that too much not enough or what
for seven um
uh huh yep with seven how much do i have to order
so you have twenty so you have twenty slices altogether so that's gonna give everybody a least two slices each and most of them three if they wanted an extra one
it really should be fine right
yeah the wings um that pretty much only gives everybody one wing each that's up to you
the wing is only for one person 'cause he she doesn't like pizza
oh okay

no we have
she's been trying and trying and trying
no that extra large with three drinks is not nine ninety nine it's nineteen forty nine i think what she wanted to do is we have the extra large for two toppings eleven ninety nine and that one would be cheaper for pepperoni half green peppers
yeah maybe that's why it wasn't working because there's no such special but this one works out to being better
which one
the eleven ninety nine one extra large two toppings
so you wanted pepperoni on the whole
<cont> the drinks
no there's no drinks with it the ones you're mentioning was
oh nineteen
eleven ninety nine the one the one with the three drinks is eighteen forty nine
okay
if you want with drinks i can add three drinks but it's still going to work out being cheaper than the one for eighteen forty nine
how much would it be with the drinks
if i add you if i add three drinks for you the total with the tax would be seventeen twenty seven
oh gosh too much yeah
so i'll take off the drinks
just put one actually just coke zero that's it
one coke zero okay
yeah
your total with tax would be fifteen oh one
fifteen
yeah
oh wow i think at pizza nova is so much cheaper than you guys i just got a large one for nine ninety nine

thank you for calling pizza palace can i please start with your phone number
four one six
mm hmm
nine nine six
nine nine six
seven four three two
four three two and will that be delivery or pickup
i can't hear you
oh sorry will that be delivery or pickup
i can pick it up if i know where the closest one is to where i live
um let's see it looks like we've got uh burnhamthorpe road here in mississauga
yeah so where's the _garbled
so it's three eight five prince wales and it says it's located in the same plaza as the winners uh shoppers drug mart uh and it's right behind
three eighyt five what
sorry just a moment
what's the address well i'll just put three eighty five
oh sorry so i've got three nine six zero grand park drive
three nine six zero grand park drive and where is this
uh it says it's located in the same plaza as uh winners and a shoppers drug mart on the west side
oh okay
of burnhamthorpe
sheppard okay
do you have any specials
uh we do have an extra large one topping for uh let's see we have an extra large one topping for nine ninety nine right now as well as a medium one topping for six ninety nine um
let me do the extra large
mm hmm
how much would it be for two two um if i just one more top okay two extra toppings how much is that
so three toppings would come to fourteen oh nine
then i want three toppings
and what would you like on that
on the half of it i need pineapple and broccoli
pineapple and broccoli on half okay
is that is that three or just two toppings _garbled
that counts as one topping because they're each just a half
yes pineapple and broccoli on half the other half i need pineapple broccoli and tomato
pineapple broccoli and tomato on the other half
mm hmm
so that
how many toppings will that be
that comes to three toppings or sorry two and a half toppings altogether uh so that comes out to fourteen oh nine
well you said fourteen oh nine is that three toppings so i should get another one cuz that's two and a half
just double checking here
so give me double pineapple with the broccoli
double pineapple and broccoli on the whole thing
no on one half give me okay let's start over on one half give me double broccoli and pineapple
double broccoli and double pineapple on the one half
it's gonna be two more toppings if i do that
so you just wanted the double broccoli on half and the regular one regular pineapple on that half
i think it's confusing for you let's start over do pineapple on the whole on the whole thing
pineapple on the whole pizza okay
broccoli on the whole thing
broccoli on the whole pizza
yes and then i still have one more topping right
that's right
to make three so i need half with tomato
<cont> half give me another broccoli
<cont> half another broccoli
yeah does that make sense
that makes sense
it's three toppings
so i've got pineapple on the whole pizza broccoli on the whole pizza half tomato and half double broccoli
right
would you like any drinks or dipping sauce with that
two creamy garlic
two creamy garlic
yes and that's it
i'm so sorry about this we're having a bit of trouble with our software uh so i'm just gonna have to pass your order over to customer service it should just be one moment please
do i have to repeat this
um i'm gonna send your number over so they should be able to see your order and it'll just be one moment i'm so sorry about that
oh okay
hello my name is jane may i have your ten digit phone number please
four one six nine nine six seven four three two
seven four three two all right
do i have to repeat do i have to repeat the order
uh oh i see um i see what they wanted you wanted to order three toppings on the extra large that you pickup in the store is that correct
mm hmm
yeah we can't do that anymore you have to order the special they changed it
i have to do what
they've changed it it's just a one topping uh pizza so you can't order you can't add any more toppings to it
even if i go there
uh yeah even if you go there uh they've changed all their specials now you'll have to order the the the three topping special
so what is the three topping special
yes ma'am let me just see well the three topping special is eighteen forty nine comes with three drinks that's before taxes
pardon me
it's eighteen forty nine i believe for three toppings an extra large
how much
it comes with three drinks and but that's before and that's that's before taxes
so you're saying i have to order like that in order to get three toppings i have to the get the drinks with it
well it's cheaper that
i don't understand what you're saying
it's cheaper that way it's a special they don't have it anymore they used to have the one topping and you could add more toppings to the base of that it's just the one topping pizza
so if i want three toppings what do i do
the best thing for you to do would be to order the special that's eighteen forty nine and it comes with three drinks it's the it's the cheaper cheapest way to do it
then do that
so hold on for a minute then so this for deliv is this is for pickup you said
mm hmm
<cont> where are you picking
um she said it's thirty nine sixty grand park drive
drive okay all right so that's the one that's on the west side of burnhamthorpe road same plaza as winners and that okay
burnhamthorpe and what
uh it's the west side of burnhamthorpe road it's located in the same plaza as the winners shoppers drug mart and it's behind kelsey's so it's three nine six zero grand park drive
right
and just a second here and who shall i say is picking up the first name
lyn l y n
that was my mum's name
oh yeah
yeah very interesting
_garbled i just spoke with some i just spoke with somebody and they asked me for my husband's date of birth and she goes oh that's my date of birth too
i agree it's funny all the coincidences in life
yeah
so yeah the best bet would be because if i just built one i think it would come to far more than the special and the special is eighteen forty nine
she said it's fourteen o nine the way i ordered this
exactly before but it won't let you do it now you have to do it through the special so what were the toppings on it that you wanted
i want the whole thing with pineapple
<cont> the whole thing with broccoli
broccoli okay
<cont> half with tomato and half with broccoli again
oh i can't do that so you want you want half tomato on one side but you want broccoli on the whole thing i can't i can't give it uh you wanted double broccoli on one side is that correct
right right
yeah it's not gonna do that
either double broccoli or double pineapple any one
yeah it won't let me do that i can't i can't i can put it on the whole thing or put double on the whole thing i can't do double on one side our system doesn't allow us to do that unfortunately
give me double pineapple on the whole thing
so we'll do double pineapple all right and it comes with three drinks three coke products what would you like
how many
three so i have coke classic diet and zero uh canada orange cream soda uh root beer
do you have ginger beer
no i have root beer nestea and sprite
one sprite
mm hmm
one orange one coke
one coke there we go okay now
i'll have to take two creamy garlic
two creamy garlic okay
all right so when i added that extra topping on the whole thing it changed the price a little bit it went up to twenty fifty four do you want
to what twenty four what
well it went from eighteen forty nine to twenty fifty four with an extra topping
just give me the _garbled broccoli i don't know what's what's going on
oh no no
they told me that you can get three toppings
yeah i can't because you've got tomatoes on half so it's like that so you don't want the tomato
i don't want tomato i don't have tomato on it anymore
so take the tomatoes off so hold on
yeah so can you do that
yeah i can take the tomatoes off like i could keep the tomatoes on i just couldn't make it double that's what you're asking me all right so there it knocked it back down
sorry
so now you've got broccoli and double pineapple is that good
how much
all right so with um and you're picking up so with taxes just making sure you're picking up at grand park drive and it's for lyn the extra large broccoli double pineapple with a coke and orange and a sprite two creamy garlic your total with tax is twenty two dollars and sixty eight cents all right
but that's so high
i know because you can't do that um that special anymore yeah the special you'd only be able to have one topping on it
is that's extra large how much if it's just large how much would it be
uh large oh that would be a little bit cheaper because i can do the the large for the same thing hold on uh let me see here it would be a large with the same things on it with the broccoli double pineapple here we go _garbled the difference is three fifty plus tax cheaper do you wanna go with the large instead
what's the total for the large if the extra large is the twenty two fifty eight
so right now your total is eighteen seventy two
with the tax
yeah with tax
eighteen seventy two
yeah two dipping sauces your large pizza and your three drinks so it's yeah eighteen seventy two
eighteen seventy two _garbled that's just over three dollars difference
yeah it's three it's three fifty between the pizzas and then plus tax so
so how many slices is large and how many slices is extra large
oh large is ten extra large is twelve
so i wanna take the large
but i wanna change instead of double pineapple i want spinach instead
that's spinach spinach broccoli and pineapple
hold on so we'll take off one of the pineapples
is that _garbled
yeah i got it i'm i'm gonna repeat it to you anyway and then put spinach there we go i'm going to do summary and make sure it shows that yeah it shows it has broccoli pineapple and spinach is that correct
mm hmm
and two creamy garlic and then your coke your orange and your sprite so your total comes to eighteen dollars and seventy two cents all right so it's like five twenty six your order will be ready in fifteen minutes at five forty one is that good for you

the large one can i do like um like a meat lover's kind of
so bacon crumble pepperoni and spicy italian sausage is fine

i'm sorry no we have chorizo sausage and spicy italian sausage
sorry what kind of sausage
chorizo chorizo sausage and a spicy italian sausage
is the chorizo especially spicy _garbled
i'm sorry
are they both spicy sausage
uh for sure the spicy italian sausage is the spicy but chorizo i'm not sure if it's spicy or not
_garbled for the meat lovers it comes with _garbled sausage
so you can make the ground beef if you like to change make the brown beef or ham or any other thing

for sure no problem dear and the medium cauliflower crust pizza
the medium cauliflower um we'll do cheese pepperoni
it's _garbled so
okay so pepperoni mushrooms green pepper
mushroom green pepper and pepperoni
she said they don't only come to the medium for the cauliflower so what have to do is do the large pizza with wings first _garbled because they only make cauliflower pizza in medium
so your total is with the tax and delivery all together is fifty dollar eighty five cents because the cauliflower _garbled has a three dollar extra
_garbled fifty dollars _garbled i don't know what should we do _garbled i just want the heavy dough right is it _garbled if we drop the wings _garbled i don't think _garbled they have a whole pizza there in _garbled okay fine okay can we just take off the wings maybe and see how much it is

sixteen seventy five do you think _garbled forty one twenty five plus tax it's five dollar eight five cents delivery is three seventy five all together fifty eighty five
i'm just talking with her they're saying it's a little bit too expensive
mm hmm yeah i understand or if you want we _garbled two topping or like make the only the pepperoni like that so it's cheaper a little cheaper if you want just the pepperoni on the cauliflower then we check how much it is
forty seven um let me try and think you guys don't have a medium pizza with wings like for the meat lover's
same thing same thing i can the large pizza deal same thing with a medium
it's the same size
yeah the small
_garbled pizzas and wings
medium large has the same price
does it why would it be the same price
that's why i _garbled the large
oh 'cause i was looking online and
if you really want the cauliflower crust that's fine if you doesn't want like if you doesn't want the cauliflower _garbled make the two largest _garbled and the ten chicken wings
the cauliflower crust how much actually is cauliflower crust three dollars and
three dollars three dollars extra
like this is the _garbled
_garbled one let me let me tell you one second hold on uh if you put the cauliflower it's right now it's eight ninety five and uh cauliflower crust is with eleven ninety five plus toppings
what about the the meat lovers _garbled yeah the medium large is twenty four fifteen large twenty four fifty but really should be large for the guys they get like eight how much is the large how many slices is the large

_garbled it's a
gourmet pizza like the toppings just come with that it's not like you have to add the toppings like the topping is the _garbled garlic _garbled parmesan cheese and italian italian _garbled pizza
_garbled veggie yeah basically it's a _garbled this one _garbled _garbled this one has cauliflower crust extra virgin olive oil base mozzarella cheese artichoke _garbled
yeah grilled zucchini parmesan cheese and italian
yeah but how much cheaper is that pizza
because it's got so many toppings it's fifteen ninety nine i added it's forty nine anyway but you get more topping than you make uh only the mushroom green pepper and pepperoni

all right what address are we delivering to
twenty five summerhill gardens toronto
and that's the front door of the house today
yes and i have a question i was given a validation number for pizza palace what does that mean
uh o o okay a validation number when were you given this validation number
well they were doing it just a promotion for uh answering a survey
oh okay
<cont> i i participated in the survey
and usually it tells you what you get for free what what item does it say that you have that you get
oh they just gave me a number
oh a number all right i'm probably gonna have to put you over to customer service for that not for the whole thing but i'm just saying for that one then they will be able to tell you what um item that that validation number would be attached to because usually whenever you do a survey online usually it tells you what you're getting and uh most of these items can only be uh received when you order online but that's why i wanna patch you over to them after we do the order and then that way they can kind of figure out what it is that you're supposed to be getting for free and then they can go ahead and add that free item for you
oh i see
yeah
so what they do is add the free item it's not a discount
um well a validation that you're you said that you got that validation number when you did a survey
correct
<cont> that survey was from your receipt was that uh _garbled
um yeah well i had to _garbled in from my receipt it would have been i had to _garbled in certain information on the survey
right
from my receipt
it sounds like that one there i don't want to just i mean usually it's an item that you get a coke item but i wanna be sure so what i'll do is after i place your order um and i put it through to the restaurant i can patch over to them then they'll be able to figure it out more and then they'll be able to let you know what what exactly that that's for
so what else did you wanna get today
uh i'll take i assume its uh the large pizza is on special today is that
uh that's an ongoing deal we have
right
it's a large three topping three pop special for fourteen ninety nine did you wanna get that
i'll get that plus um you know the that's why i actually called to complained about the last _garbled because i was charged for honey garlic sauce and bags of chips the last time and i asked the guy whether _garbled he said yes but then when they came with the bill they _garbled on the bill and i paid _garbled and then i phoned up to complained and i got a survey
sounds like a credit sounds like you might have gotten a credit okay so i'm gonna check for a credit after this just to see if a credit was applied on your account it will be easy for me to figure that out
um i'm looking at your last order your so you're saying that you got you got a honey garlic and you got some bags of chips now did were you aware that you were getting that package deal
well i was asked on the phone did i want them and i distinctly asked the guy were they _garbled and he said yes
mm hmm it was included in that package it was a little bit more but if you were getting a dip sauce it came with the dip and the bags of chips it was just a little bit more that the fourteen ninety nine
oh uh honey garlic was seventy nine cents and i'm looking at the bill here in front me and it's three bags of chips with a dollar ninety nine
oh yes it's broken down in that way but it is a separate pack now we have the package excuse me we have the package deal where you get the large three toppings and three pop special for fourteen nineteen for seventeen ninety eight or in that case seventeen ninety nine it comes with uh you still get the large three topping you get the bags of chips and the dips now it's broken down but it is um it is part of a different package which is seventeen ninety nine
i see
mm hmm now
i didn't want that i didn't really want them i just ask _garbled i'll take them like maybe _garbled
right and that's okay i mean you called and you it sounds like you get a credit for that so um all right so you wanna make are you saying to me that you wanna make sure today that you just get the large three topping and three pop special and that's it
yes so whatever i'm entitled to _garbled
sure uh all right let me check your credit let me see about the credit here first of all now usually there's a na it would be under this phone number i'm sure and usually there's a name that they attach to it what would be the name that they would use for the credit
the name on my pizza is una u n a
u n a okay let me try this here okay i'm not seeing a credit huh okay mm _garbled mm all right i'm not seeing a credit so um i guess what i will definitely do though is when the order is finished i will put you over to customer service and see if they can they will take care of whatever that validation number is supposed to cover
all right let me just refresh this system of mine real quick here all right well if this is what you're ordering and it's all based on that validation number did you want me to just go ahead and put you over to customer service and see if they're if that what you're you ordering every any everything is gonna be based on that validation number today
well i'm ordering the large pizza with the three cans well i'll say water instead of pop _garbled i don't want the honey garlic and the chips _garbled extra charge
you will not get that today you will not get that at all okay so did you want the same toppings of last time with the pineapple roasted red bell peppers and broccoli
correct
all right let's do that up here okay all right and the three bottles of water which are included okay all right so today all you're getting is a large three toppings which is broccoli pineapple roasted red bell peppers and the three bottles of water that comes with it that's it there's nothing else there
good
the total after the taxes and delivery would be twenty one eighteen
all right so i will put that order to the store your guarantee time is gonna be six twelve on your order today and in the meantime while i send that over the store and everything is being cooked you hold the line for one moment i'm gonna patch to customer service and you let them know what you told me about your validation number and they'll look into it further and figure out what that is

so uh the pep on the same pepperoni pizza
on the same pizza so half of it will be pepperoni
mm hmm
the other half black olives

sure
but uh lately it hasn't been allowing us to put half and half let me just try _garbled
sure you know what if you put
mm hmm
um oh okay so you can't put the olives on just half
um that's what i'm trying to see here uh
oh okay
that's for the special let me see just give me a second let me uh try that
sure
<cont> see if it works yeah and that's for the special
you know what if you put it on if you put it on the whole thing
mm hmm
then then we can take them off
but no there's the thing though um i was gonna say usually when you go pick it up for the medium one topping
yeah
you can get a special price for six ninety nine but lately
oh okay
it hasn't been allowing us for that particular special to add anything else at all
i see
so if you want to add anything else at all
oh okay
you'll get you'll get it for the regular price which is uh it's for six ninety nine that's gonna be around like ten
well you know what we'll do then
sixty five
i'll just do the medium pepperoni and cheese and we can have some olives at home
okay perfect
so will that work for the _garbled
yes yes yes absolutely
so medium pepperoni
perfect that will be the first one
perfect all right
yeah
yeah you'll get it for the price then now
yeah
for your second one
for the next do you carry like an extra large size
mm hmm yeah yeah absolutely
how many people does that feed
so um that's twelve slices so i don't know
how many slices are _garbled
so that's good
right
so this one is kind of the i hear that you have the cauliflower crust now
yes unfortunately that's only for um medium and on at the moment the specific store you're going to is out of caulifrower cru uh crust at the moment
oh they don't have any
not they don't have anymore they're _garbled
you don't gotcha okay
yes
so um maybe what we'll do then um
yeah _garbled
it has been okay
yes
um let me think about this
uh you do carry the gluten free crust dough right
yes uh that's only in uh in small tough there's only one size
only in small
small
yes
does the does the crust have any um dairy product in it or is it just gluten like the regular
it's the regular yes so you have the choices to make in regular um
yes
uh whole wheat
or and yeah by whole wheat i mean whole grain
or um cauli which is not uh at the not _garbled at the moment or gluten free
right
with only the small
dad they're out of cauliflower crust yeah just at that location so so we could try maybe the other one okay maybe what we'll do
mm hmm
um
you wanna try another location
so where is your other location in thunder bay
uh let me search that actually locations in thunder bay
just give me a second
thank you
yeah no problem let's see thunder bay
a game okay don't worry about that what is it n i have a magic word
so i have uh uh
_garbled yes
four twenty five edward street north i have another one in uh i have two actually the one is in red river and the other one was four twenty five edward street north
edward street north okay
mm hmm
maybe we'll maybe we'll place the order for that one then because then we can get the cauliflower crust
that one okay let me system that out yes they'll yeah it'll be good for the ca cauliflower crust order
perfect
it only comes in the medium though
yeah we'll just change the pickup yeah that's okay
_garbled
oh i'll get two medium then
all right so the first medium one uh you wanna do do you wanna stick with the one that with the pepperoni one for the walk in special
yes yeah
that's perfect so that's that now
for the uh cauliflower now we have um we can get it in the regular cauliflower crust pizza with just the uh just the the the the cheese in the side
or you get cauli p uh pesto or the cauli blanca
so cauli pesto comes with the um the cauliflower crust obviously uh pesto sauce mozzarella cheese fire roasted red peppers spinach grilled chicken italiano blend seasoning
the other one comes with uh the cauli blanca comes with uh cauliflower crust extra virgin olive oil mozzarella cheese
mm hmm
artichokes uh sorry artichokes um roasted garlic grilled zucchini parmesan cheese and italiano blend seasoning and you always have the choice to add more if you want to
so can we i'm trying to think because we're trying to get um the pizza with no dairy product at all so no cheese
no dairy product okay i can remove the cheese
so you can remove the cheese for me _garbled
yes yes if they will receive
but let me see if uh the cauliflower doesn't contain any uh dairy products here i can remove yeah i can definitely remove the cheese and then
before replacing with a dairy free cheese _garbled
oh you have a dairy free cheese
we do have the dairy free cheese yes
really i wonder what's in that
uh yeah that's a good question
good question good question um okay so should we try dairy free cheese or should we go no cheese i don't know what dairy free cheese is _garbled okay so we're gonna go with the no cheese
no cheese
so maybe we'll get um yeah we'll get w we'll try each of those
so you wanna get each of these uh the specialty uh cauliflower pizzas
yeah
<cont> then we'll just get them with no cheese
so i'll get you a cauli pesto with no cheese all right
and then do you have any kind of meat that we can add on there
yeah absolutely you can add anything you want we got bacon chicken steak uh salami pepperoni um
well there's the one so the one already has chicken right
uh let me see here there's one that i think already had chicken let me go back here
so there's one
thank you for your patience by the way
no no problem there is one
_garbled over here _garbled
absolutely yeah it's important absolutely it's definitely important um
yeah
so the first one has grilled chicken the cauli pesto has grilled chicken already
the other one um you see the other the cauli blanca has um no the cauli blanca doesn't have any uh meat but the pesto does have the grilled chicken in it already
so the pesto one has the grilled chicken so we'll leave it like it is i think we're probably gonna have to get it without the pesto too because pesto usually has parmesan in it
_garbled i see okay so the pesto oh you also okay so let me just remove the pesto sauce hold on just give me a second
and just maybe the olive the olive oil is good
the olive oil okay so you want to replace this
oh careful _garbled careful
do you wanna replace the pesto sauce with the olive oil
sure
can you do that
let's do that yeah absolutely so
please
let's replace the sauce instead of the pesto sauce we'll do extra virgin olive oil base
great
<cont> then um i'll do no no cheese all right
yep perfect
<cont> then the rest of roasted red peppers spinach grilled chicken italian blend seasoning is that okay
that all sound good
perfect okay so that's for the cauli pesto
yep
you wanna try the other one also as you said
i'm sorry say that again
so you wanna try the other one as well the cauli blanca
yes yeah the other one too we'll give it a try
so cauli blanca so yes you have the cauli
can you do that one again too
absolutely cauliflower crust
thank you
uh extra virgin olive oil base
yep
just like
awesome
the other one you had uh i'll remove the cheese coz _garbled cheese
so i'll remove the cheese
yep
no cheese artichokes um roasted garlic
mm hmm
grilled zucchini parmesan cheese and italiano blend seasoning is that okay
so if we remove the parmesan
mm hmm oh yes yes uh yeah i don't know how that yeah i'll remove the parmesan cheese
oh yeah but that's okay no no
yeah
no worries at all
remove the parmesan cheese
remove the parmesan and maybe
mm hmm
<cont> maybe we could add like do you have a _garbled salami or do you have a _garbled or something
uh what sorry
uh a salami or _garbled that you could add
i have salami i don't know _garbled
maybe we'll add salami on that one
yes we will do salami instead
so hold on just give me a sec okay got it okay uh anything else you wanna add or _garbled

<cont> can i i think frankly you got _garbled with the last two transactions order and i can never seem like to redeem it so i have no clue what's going on
sir so i can find out how many points you have
mm hmm
so i need your loyalty card number please
uh yeah um
but you have to place your order first
uh yeah _garbled trying to do it online where i'm at and
yes you can find out your loyalty number on the mobile app also you have to place an order _garbled
yeah yeah i can't use it i'm trying yeah i see it but i can't use it seems seems like i'm always been trying to use it but i can never use it that's one of my issues
_garbled i will i will transfer you to customer service so _garbled just a second
thank you so much
hello my name is sunny can i start with your phone number please
four one six
mm hmm
nine two three
mm hmm
five seven seven five
kay so four one six nine two three five seven seven five
yep
kay and how may i help you
um i'm just trying to figure out how to use the loyalty um uh
_garbled i've been trying to redeem it every time i order and right now i have time to call you guys but uh
normally i don't
no problem um so you have a loyalty card and it is registered to your account
yeah
do you mind if you um give me your card number so i can check the balance
sure um three zero eight four nine
mm hmm
three six five
mm hmm
two five three six
mm hmm
two five one
mm hmm
three five two one
one second okay um i do see a balance of zero okay so i don't think your card is registered
uh uh the card _garbled
i can tell when you bought it
mm hmm
but i i can't see the registration
mm hmm
so the points have never been able to be added to the account officially i'm pretty sure you still see the balance every time you place an order online um so what i would recommend at this point is try registering a card and the balance should be transferred on to the card it does take up to forty eight hours um
but i do actually i think i've registered my card though because it says um when i sign in online i my card's there
yeah
when i order i think the loyalty _garbled the card it seems
but have you associated it with your account
uh yes i did
sorry
uh yes i have
i'm not sure what's the issue then
yeah i don't know either at some point it's really annoying i just think i have to call _garbled
yeah because i see that you regularly press um sorry make order orders with us but um no i just think it still needs to be registered i see that it has been activated so i'm assuming that's when you bought it but um okay can you go on the website and tell me what you see when you log in
um yeah
so i'll go i'll order online i actually signed in already
it says hello jerry and loyalty earned twenty two dollars and ninety six cents available balance zero
can you press that
which part
uh the loyalty earned
uh no _garbled to press it
no okay so it says loyalty earned is twenty two and then available balance is zero
yep
um
by going to account settings i could see my card under club uh
eleven eleven
eleven eleven yeah
uh huh okay let's see mm you should
oh yeah actually that's also say congratulations you have you have successfully registered your number to pizza palace club eleven eleven program
when when did it say that
if i go into account's um account settings
is there a date yes
no there's no date
so i need to register it okay and that was three zero eight four nine three six five two five three six two five one three five two one
sorry uh sorry i didn't i couldn't keep track
oh three oh eight
mm hmm
four nine three
mm hmm
six five two
mm hmm
five three six
mm hmm
two five one
mm hmm
three five two
mm hmm
<cont> a one
so yeah i do um mm i do see that i it's activated but you _garbled registered
mm
has it recently been registered
no i believe i registered when i first started ordering online
give me one second okay let me um okay so i'm gonna put you on a brief hold and see what could be wrong okay
thank you
thank you hello
hello
hi there thank you so much for holding so um it says congratulations what congra
congratulations you you have successfully registered your number for pizza palace club eleven eleven program
yeah mm hmm so the way that works is that the card is registered but you have to fill out this whole form with like your name your email your address um to just make sure the card is now associated to your account and that's when the balance will be put through and you'll be able to use it
_garbled
registering is not the same as connecting it to your account
where uh is there something i can do you think
yeah if you just log in to the um your your account sorry i mean you register your account i'm so sorry register your card onto your account but associated to it
um
_garbled i'm not sure where the settings is because i'm not logging on the same screen as you but i'm pretty sure it once you log in and you want to register your card onto your account it's gonna pull up a form that you have to fill out and it's generally like your name your email um your address
um i wonder if it was because i did it a long time ago and the program just wasn't as good at the time because i'm i'm pretty sure i sure have registered it _garbled
it is registered but it's not associated to your account
mm
mm hmm
but it's linked it's linked to my
sorry
but it's linked into my account right because i could
it is yeah you registered it but you have to associate it to your account so i think that's why but once it is then the balance should be showing up and you should be able to use it
um i don't see anywhere for me to enter the additional information
give me one second okay so when you logged in
mm hmm
<cont> then you press account settings the first thing you see is congratulations you registered your card
um account total um under the club eleven eleven tab
yeah
it says congratulations you have successfully registered your card through
um yeah program and at the top it does it does have my email my name and my address and my phone number
mm hmm yep that's that's always there it's with the card um
i never entered the address before like wonder at club eleven eleven _garbled there's coupon wallet then there's _garbled address
i know
_garbled enter an address
mm hmm
i should try doing that _garbled
so you've gone through the club eleven eleven registration with the account information the card information the personal information the address information
um well i did this like a few years ago right so
so ho go on fan zone
going on what fan
fan zone it's it's on the same um the same next to order up find us join our family company and fan zone
uh fan zone yep
<cont> then press club eleven eleven gift card
<cont> did the club eleven eleven registration come
yep
does that look familiar
i probably did that a long long time ago
cause that's the only um thing i could think of to properly register your card and associate it to your account so _garbled about it it's not because i can't see your screen i mean it's definitely harder for me to see what's the issue you can definitely stop at your local pizza palace store at any time
mm hmm
<cont> just request them to help you i know they'll be gladly to i've already spoken to a couple stores that do help their customers register their card and everything
then so if they're not able to do anything either then
no but if you fill out
i'll try to _garbled
i mean they should be because they seen your screen and if they if you do register through the registration um page that i just told you through the fan zone
mm hmm
then your card should be associated to your account it does not take sorry it does take up to forty eight hours for the balance to show
mm hmm so you could give that a try if there's any issues just give us a call back but at least then we would have known that okay you filled out the form everything should be okay we would have to look deeper into the issue rather than just the surface
so uh so is the log in for the registration _garbled log in for pizza palace
yeah it is
so it's a completely different log in
yeah no it's the same log in it's just when you registering the card to register the card it's different than to register into your account
um i'm i'm just saying _garbled fan zone
mm hmm
there's a log in
yeah
so _garbled pizza palace log in there or is it like completely different site than that screen we have _garbled
oh since you're already log logged in you don't have to log in again you can just press register
oh i can
yeah you can just press register sorry i thought you were there the whole time
um huh interesting cause when i click on fan zone it doesn't
it brings you to the club eleven eleven and then it says log in password
yeah
no
uh yeah log in and password
yeah and the under it says manager your card buy a gift card and then it says register swipe five and get five percent back
yeah do you see that
yeah so okay so i entered my email address and phone number okay okay i got it

so one half is italian sausage and chicken and the other half is pepperoni and extra cheese and
<cont> then uh this will be the second one for the thing right or is extra cheese counted as two toppings
uh extra cheese and chicken both are the premium topping will cost you dollar extra for both toppings
a dollar extra
yeah dollar extra for both toppings because _garbled
why is there a dollar extra for extra cheese
no like fifty cents extra for chicken and fifty cents extra for cheese extra cheese
so you charge fifty cents for extra cheese
yeah
it should be a topping though _garbled
_garbled it's a premium topping that's why it will cost you extra
that doesn't make sense the pizza already comes with cheese
_garbled now i'm adding the topping yeah you're adding a topping of extra cheese that's a topping it's premium that's why its price is more as compared to the regular topping so that's why _garbled
no no hold on a second i order a pizza it comes with sauce and cheese correct
yeah already comes with the cheese
so why would i pay extra if i get two toppings that doesn't make sense my topping is pepperoni and now i want cheese on top of the cheese so i shouldn't have to pay for it that's my second topping cheese already comes with the pizza
you can choose any other topping if you don't want to pay extra for that
do you want do you want that _garbled pepperoni and bacon strips it doesn't make any sense _garbled yeah the bacon strips no no that's okay okay so you want the pepperoni and cheese so that's one topping cheese already comes with it that's one so chicken and uh italian sausage and tomato on the other half so that's four toppings total
like tomatoes on which half with the pepperoni half or with the chicken half
with uh the chicken half
sure so one half with the chicken tomatoes and spicy italian sausage right
yeah
<cont> the other half with just pepperoni and regular mozzarella cheese right
<cont> regular cheese
yeah sure and i just wanna let you know now there is fifty cents extra for the chicken because that's a premium topping as i mentioned to you before okay so only fifty cents extra for chicken okay
<cont> how much okay now hold on and uh uh
